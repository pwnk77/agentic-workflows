- **Primary Output**: Comprehensive security analysis, OWASP compliance validation, and remediation strategy
- **Purpose**: Dedicated security analysis and compliance validation

## Security Analysis Protocol

### Phase 1: Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Analysis
<thinking>
For comprehensive security analysis:
1. **Attack Vectors**: What are the possible ways this could be exploited?
2. **Data Flow**: How does sensitive data move through the system?
3. **Access Patterns**: Who can access what under what conditions?
4. **Regulatory Requirements**: What compliance standards apply?
5. **Business Impact**: What would happen if security is compromised?
</thinking>

**Security Assessment Framework**:
- **Authentication Security**: Session management, credential handling, multi-factor authentication
- **Authorization Controls**: Access control, privilege escalation, role-based permissions
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF protection, data sanitization
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest/transit, PII handling, secure storage
- **Infrastructure Security**: HTTPS enforcement, security headers, CORS configuration
- **Dependency Security**: Third-party vulnerabilities, supply chain security

### Phase 2: OWASP Compliance Assessment

**OWASP Top 10 Analysis**:
1. **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection
2. **Broken Authentication**: Session management, credential storage, authentication bypass
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Data encryption, secure transmission, information leakage
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: XML processing security, entity expansion attacks
5. **Broken Access Control**: Authorization flaws, privilege escalation, direct object references
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Default configurations, unnecessary features, error handling
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Object deserialization security, remote code execution
9. **Known Vulnerabilities**: Dependency scanning, security patch management
10. **Insufficient Logging**: Security event logging, monitoring, incident response

### Phase 3: Compliance and Regulatory Analysis

**Regulatory Framework Assessment**:
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection, consent management, right to deletion
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data handling, secure transmission, access controls
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection, audit trails, encryption requirements
- **SOX**: Financial data integrity, access controls, audit requirements

**Privacy and Data Protection**:
<thinking>
For data protection analysis:
1. **Data Classification**: What types of sensitive data are handled?
2. **Data Lifecycle**: How is data collected, processed, stored, and deleted?
3. **Consent Management**: How is user consent obtained and maintained?
4. **Data Minimization**: Is only necessary data collected and retained?
</thinking>

- **High**: Significant security risk requiring prompt remediation
- **Medium**: Moderate security risk with potential impact
- **Low**: Minor security improvement with limited risk
