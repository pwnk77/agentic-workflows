# SpecGen MCP Server v2.0.0
## Specification Management with Dashboard Integration

### üîß AVAILABLE TOOLS (5 total - READ-ONLY MCP)

**list_specs** - List all specification files with metadata
‚Ä¢ Returns: All SPEC-*.md files with title, category, status, modified date
‚Ä¢ Parameters: None required
‚Ä¢ Usage: Get overview of all specifications in the project

**get_spec** - Retrieve full specification content
‚Ä¢ Parameters: feature (string) - filename or feature name
‚Ä¢ Returns: Complete markdown content of specification
‚Ä¢ Usage: Read detailed specification for implementation

**search_specs** - Full-text search across specifications
‚Ä¢ Parameters: query (string) - search text
‚Ä¢ Returns: Matching specs with highlighted context
‚Ä¢ Usage: Find specifications containing specific keywords

**refresh_metadata** - Scan and update metadata cache
‚Ä¢ Parameters: reason (string, optional) - why refresh is needed
‚Ä¢ Updates: Shared .spec-metadata.json file
‚Ä¢ Usage: Call after file changes (especially post-architect/engineer)

**launch_dashboard** - Start web dashboard interface
‚Ä¢ Parameters: port (number, optional) - default: 4567
‚Ä¢ Returns: Dashboard URL (http://localhost:PORT)
‚Ä¢ Usage: Launch CRUD interface for visual spec management
‚Ä¢ IMPORTANT: Run refresh_metadata first to populate dashboard with specs

### üìã WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

**After architect command:**
\`\`\`
refresh_metadata(reason: "architect command completed")
\`\`\`

**After engineer command:**
\`\`\`
refresh_metadata(reason: "engineer command completed")
\`\`\`

**For dashboard access:**
\`\`\`
# IMPORTANT: Always refresh metadata before launching dashboard
refresh_metadata(reason: "preparing dashboard data")
launch_dashboard(port: 4567) // Spawns dashboard with all specs visible
\`\`\`

**Note:** The dashboard requires metadata to be refreshed first to see all specifications from subdirectories.

### üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE & DOCS DETECTION

**Project Structure Required:**
‚Ä¢ Specs: ./docs/SPEC-*.md (relative to where MCP is run)
‚Ä¢ Metadata: ./docs/.spec-metadata.json (shared with dashboard)
‚Ä¢ Dashboard: Uses globally installed specdash (auto-detected)

**How Docs Folder Detection Works:**
‚Ä¢ MCP always looks for specs in the 'docs/' folder relative to your current directory
‚Ä¢ Run MCP commands from your project root (where you want docs/ to be)
‚Ä¢ Global install: Dashboard from /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/specgen-mcp/specdash
‚Ä¢ Local install: Dashboard from project/.specgen/specdash
‚Ä¢ Specs always from: {your-current-directory}/docs/

**Troubleshooting:**
‚Ä¢ No specs found? Ensure you're in the right directory with a docs/ folder
‚Ä¢ Dashboard not launching? Check that specgen-mcp is installed globally or locally
‚Ä¢ Wrong specs showing? Make sure you're running from the correct project root

### ‚ö° CAPABILITIES
‚Ä¢ Read-only operations on markdown files
‚Ä¢ Shared metadata management with dashboard
‚Ä¢ Process spawning for dashboard launch
‚Ä¢ File system monitoring integration
‚Ä¢ JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant error handling

### üîí SECURITY & ARCHITECTURE
‚Ä¢ READ-ONLY MCP operations (no create_spec/update_spec tools)
‚Ä¢ Write operations handled by /architect and /engineer commands
‚Ä¢ Metadata updates via atomic writes
‚Ä¢ Path validation and sanitization
‚Ä¢ Dashboard launches in controlled environment

### üìù WRITE OPERATIONS (Via Commands)
‚Ä¢ Use /architect command to create new specs
‚Ä¢ Use /engineer command to update existing specs
‚Ä¢ MCP refresh_metadata called automatically after commands
