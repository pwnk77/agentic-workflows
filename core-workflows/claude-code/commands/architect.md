# ARCHITECT MODE SPECIFICATION COMMAND

**Goal**: To be executed in Claude Code. This command guides the AI through a structured process to analyze a feature request, explore the codebase using specialized explorer agents, and prepare a detailed plan for a specification document with precise implementation details.

**Process Overview**: You will act as a senior architect. You will perform requirement crystallization, deploy specialized explorer agents for codebase analysis, and generate comprehensive specification documents. The analysis will conclude when you have gathered all necessary information and achieved a high confidence level.

**Variable Definitions**: 
- `$FILENAME` = `docs/SPEC-[YYYYMMDD]-[feature-name].md` (primary SPEC file path)
- `$SPEC_PATH` = `docs/SPEC-[YYYYMMDD]-[feature-name].md` (file path reference)
- `$PROJECT_ROOT` = current working directory (for relative path consistency)

**Directory Structure Pattern**:
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPEC-20240115-user-authentication.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SPEC-20240115-payment-integration.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SPEC-20240116-notification-system.md
```

## PHASE 1: REQUIREMENT CRYSTALLIZATION

This phase focuses on transforming a raw feature description into a well-understood and validated set of core requirements. It involves deep analysis and iterative clarification.

**Deep Analysis Protocol (Internal Monologue):**
Before asking any questions, perform a deep analysis and ULTRA THINK the ask from the user

<thinking>
1. **Requirement Depth & Implications:**
   - What is the fundamental problem I'm trying to solve? What is the "job to be done" for the user?
   - What are the non-obvious edge cases and second-order effects of this feature? (e.g., how does it affect other teams, existing user habits, or system load?)
   - How might this feature evolve? What's the V2 or V3 of this idea? Should I design for that now?
   - What are the security, privacy, and compliance implications?

2. **Technical Feasibility & System Impact:**
   - Does the current architecture cleanly support this? If not, what's the simplest architectural change required?
   - What are the performance risks? (e.g., database query load, API response times, UI rendering speed).
   - Are there better, simpler, or more robust technical patterns we could use?
   - What potential technical debt might this introduce, and is it acceptable?

3. **Comprehensive Coverage & Risk Mitigation:**
   - Who are all the stakeholders? (e.g., end-users, support team, marketing, finance). Have their needs been considered?
   - What is the biggest risk that could cause this project to fail? (e.g., technical uncertainty, unclear requirements, dependency on another team).
   - How can I de-risk the project early? Can I build a small proof-of-concept?
   - What are the explicit non-goals for this version? What are we consciously choosing *not* to build?
</thinking>

**Initial Understanding Protocol:**
Based on the deep analysis, formulate an initial understanding of the core requirements. Identify the biggest areas of ambiguity and risk. This summary will guide the clarification process.

**Iterative Clarification Cycle:**
The goal is to move from uncertainty to a >95% confidence level by asking targeted questions.

1. **Generate Clarification Questions (Max 5 per iteration):**
   Generate clarification questions (Max 5 per iteration) to eliminate ambiguity
   - Based on the risks and ambiguities identified in the deep analysis, formulate up to 5 specific questions.
   - Each question must be designed to eliminate ambiguity and should present concrete options or examples where possible.
   - Focus on a logical progression: start with high-level conceptual questions and move towards detailed behavior, edge cases, and integration points.
2. **Synthesize Answers & Update Understanding:**
   - After receiving answers, update the internal understanding of the requirements.
   - Re-evaluate the confidence level.
3. **Repeat or Proceed:**
   - If confidence is still below 95%, repeat the cycle with a new set of questions.
   - If confidence is >95%, proceed to Phase 2.

## PHASE 2: SPECIALIZED CODEBASE EXPLORATION
