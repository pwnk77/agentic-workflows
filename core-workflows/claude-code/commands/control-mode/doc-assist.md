problem_statement: $ARGUMENTS (required: research topic or documentation need)
```

## PHASE 1: RESEARCH GOAL CLARIFICATION

**Research Analyst Agent Invocation:**

<thinking>
- What is the user's fundamental research objective?
- What scope, depth, and audience considerations are needed?

- Are there existing sources or materials to incorporate?
</thinking>

Deploy Task agent with researcher subagent:
```

   - Target audience and use case
   - Success criteria and deliverables
   - Time constraints and priorities
4. Create research plan with 95%+ confidence
5. Document objectives in docs/[topic]-research-log.md
SOURCES: $sources_folder (if provided)
DELIVERABLE: Research plan with refined objectives and user approval
```

## PHASE 3: ITERATIVE SYNTHESIS LOOP

**Synthesis and Quality Validation:**

Deploy Task agent with synthesizer subagent:
```
TASK: Research Synthesis with Goal Alignment Review
SUBAGENT: synthesizer  
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Review research findings against original objectives
2. Assess coverage and quality of all research streams
3. Identify critical gaps requiring additional research
4. Create thematic synthesis of verified findings
5. Collaborate iteratively with researcher until quality standards met
6. Maximum 3 iteration cycles before escalation
7. Update docs/[topic]-research-log.md with synthesis progress
DELIVERABLE: Complete synthesis with goal achievement assessment
```

**Synthesis Quality Gates:**
- All original research objectives addressed with supporting evidence
- Findings organized thematically for logical flow
- Gaps and limitations clearly acknowledged
- Quality assessment transparent and evidence-based

**Iterative Loop Pattern:**
1. **Synthesizer**: Gap analysis and research requests
2. **Researcher**: Targeted investigation of gap areas  
3. **Synthesizer**: Quality validation and completeness review
4. **Iteration**: Repeat until synthesis meets standards
5. **Approval Gate**: Present complete synthesis for validation

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENT TYPE SELECTION

**Document Type Classification:**

Deploy Task agent with documenter subagent for type selection:
```
TASK: Document Type Classification and Style Selection
SUBAGENT: documenter
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Present document type options to user:
   - Policy Document (organizational rules, governance)
   - Procedure Guide (step-by-step instructions)
   - Framework Document (methodologies, systematic approaches)
   - Guidelines (best practices, recommendations)
   - Technical Documentation (specs, API docs, implementation)
   - Blog/Article (engaging educational content)
   - Research Report (academic-style analysis)
   - Strategic Plan (roadmaps, implementation strategies)
2. Obtain user selection for document type
3. Consider synthesizer's document type recommendation from research log
4. Configure appropriate writing style and structure template
5. Plan document-specific visual enhancements
DELIVERABLE: Confirmed document type with style configuration
```

> **DOCUMENT TYPE CHECKPOINT**
