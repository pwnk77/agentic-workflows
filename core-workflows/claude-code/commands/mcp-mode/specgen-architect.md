# specgen-architect MODE SPECIFICATION COMMAND

**Goal**: This command guides the AI through a structured process to analyze a feature request, explore the codebase, and create detailed specifications using MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

**Process Overview**: You will act as a senior architect. You will perform requirement crystallization, codebase exploration, and specification generation using MCP tools. The analysis leverages SpecGen MCP for specification management and optionally Static Analysis MCP for TypeScript codebases.

**MCP Integration**: This command uses MCP tools for enhanced specification management:
- **specgen MCP** (`mcp__specgen-mcp__*`) for specification management with auto-categorization
- **Static Analysis MCP** (`mcp__static-analysis__*`) for TypeScript analysis (optional)

**Auto-Categorization**: SpecGen now automatically categorizes specifications based on:
- **Folder Structure**: `docs/articles/SPEC-*.md` â†’ `articles` category
- **Content Analysis**: Keywords and patterns automatically detect feature groups
- **Category Organization**: Dashboard groups specs by categories for better organization

## PHASE 1: REQUIREMENT CRYSTALLIZATION

This phase focuses on transforming a raw feature description into a well-understood and validated set of core requirements. It involves deep analysis and iterative clarification.

**Deep Analysis Protocol (Internal Monologue):**
Before asking any questions, perform a deep analysis and ULTRA THINK the ask from the user

<thinking>
1. **Requirement Depth & Implications:**
   - What is the fundamental problem I'm trying to solve? What is the "job to be done" for the user?
   - What are the non-obvious edge cases and second-order effects of this feature? (e.g., how does it affect other teams, existing user habits, or system load?)
   - How might this feature evolve? What's the V2 or V3 of this idea? Should I design for that now?
   - What are the security, privacy, and compliance implications?

2. **Technical Feasibility & System Impact:**
   - Does the current architecture cleanly support this? If not, what's the simplest architectural change required?
   - What are the performance risks? (e.g., database query load, API response times, UI rendering speed).
   - Are there better, simpler, or more robust technical patterns we could use?
   - What potential technical debt might this introduce, and is it acceptable?

3. **Comprehensive Coverage & Risk Mitigation:**
   - Who are all the stakeholders? (e.g., end-users, support team, marketing, finance). Have their needs been considered?
   - What is the biggest risk that could cause this project to fail? (e.g., technical uncertainty, unclear requirements, dependency on another team).
   - How can I de-risk the project early? Can I build a small proof-of-concept?
   - What are the explicit non-goals for this version? What are we consciously choosing *not* to build?
   - Ensure the solution is appropriately scoped and avoid over-engineering the implementation.
</thinking>

**Initial Understanding Protocol:**
Based on the deep analysis, formulate an initial understanding of the core requirements. Identify the biggest areas of ambiguity and risk. This summary will guide the clarification process.

**Iterative Clarification Cycle:**
The goal is to move from uncertainty to a >95% confidence level by asking targeted questions.

1. **Generate Clarification Questions (Max 10 per iteration):**
   Generate clarification questions (Max 10 per iteration) to eliminate ambiguity
   - Based on the risks and ambiguities identified in the deep analysis, formulate up to 10 specific questions.
   - Each question must be designed to eliminate ambiguity and should present concrete options in A/B/C format where possible to help users make quicker decisions.
   - Focus on a logical progression: start with high-level conceptual questions and move towards detailed behavior, edge cases, and integration points.
   - Example format: "For user authentication, would you prefer: A) OAuth integration, B) Custom JWT implementation, or C) Third-party service like Auth0?"
2. **Synthesize Answers & Update Understanding:**
   - After receiving answers, update the internal understanding of the requirements.
   - Re-evaluate the confidence level.
3. **Repeat or Proceed:**
   - If confidence is still below 95%, repeat the cycle with a new set of questions.
   - If confidence is >95%, proceed to Phase 2.

## PHASE 2: MULTI-PERSPECTIVE CODEBASE EXPLORATION

Deploy parallel research tasks for comprehensive analysis & research to execute the requirement and decompose it structurally.

**MCP-Enhanced Analysis Protocol:**
Before deploying sub-agents, use MCP tools for initial code discovery:

**TypeScript Analysis (Optional - if static-analysis MCP available):**
```
Use mcp__static-analysis__analyze_file for key TypeScript files
Use mcp__static-analysis__find_references for understanding symbol usage
Use mcp__static-analysis__get_compilation_errors for identifying issues
```

**Existing Specifications Discovery:**
```
Use mcp__specgen-mcp__list_specs with group_by='feature_group' to understand existing specifications by category
Use mcp__specgen-mcp__search_specs with boost_category to find related features in same category
Use mcp__specgen-mcp__get_spec_stats to see category breakdown and project overview
```
