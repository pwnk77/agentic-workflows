# specgen-engineer MODE IMPLEMENTATION COMMAND

**Goal**: Execute specifications or perform debugging with systematic implementation using MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for specification management and optional TypeScript analysis.

**Process Overview**: You will act as a diligent senior software engineer. Based on the selected mode, you will either:
1. **Implement Mode (default)**: Read a specification from SpecGen MCP and execute the defined tasks sequentially, logging progress back to MCP.
2. **Debug Mode**: Analyze a failed task using the full context of the specification and its execution logs, then propose and implement a fix.

**MCP Integration**: This command uses MCP tools for enhanced implementation:
- **specgen MCP** (`mcp__specgen-mcp__*`) for specification retrieval, updates, and category-based organization
- **Static Analysis MCP** (`mcp__static-analysis__*`) for TypeScript analysis (optional)

**Category-Aware Implementation**: SpecGen now provides category context for better implementation:
- **Feature Group Context**: Understand which category the specification belongs to
- **Related Specs Discovery**: Find related specifications in the same category for context
- **Category-Based Task Organization**: Organize implementation tasks by feature groups

**Usage Pattern**: `/specgen-engineer [mode: implement|debug] [spec-id|spec-title] <task-description>`

**Variables:**
```
mode: First argument (optional, 'implement' or 'debug', defaults to 'implement')
spec_identifier: Second argument (spec ID number or spec title/search term)
task_description: Remaining arguments (task description or issue description)
```

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. Extract `mode` from first argument if it matches 'implement' or 'debug'
2. Extract `spec_identifier` (numeric ID or text for search)
3. Combine remaining arguments as `task_description`

---

## MODE: IMPLEMENT

This is the default mode for executing a specification using MCP tools.

### PHASE 1: MCP SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS AND TASK PLANNING

1. **Specification Discovery & Loading**:
   
   **If spec_identifier is numeric (ID):**
   ```xml
   <mcp-get-spec>
   ID: [spec_identifier]
   </mcp-get-spec>
   ```
   
   **If spec_identifier is text (search term):**
   ```xml
   <mcp-search-specs>
   Query: [spec_identifier]
   Limit: 5
   </mcp-search-specs>
   ```
   Then select the most relevant specification and retrieve it with `mcp__specgen-mcp__get_spec`.
   
   **Category Context Enhancement:**
   After loading the specification, use `mcp__specgen-mcp__search_related_specs` with the spec's `feature_group` to understand related implementations and patterns within the same category.

2. **Task Ingestion & Todo List Creation**:
   - Parse the `## Implementation Plan` section from the retrieved specification
   - Extract all tasks grouped by their layer (Database, Backend, Frontend, etc.)
   - **Action**: Update the internal todo list using TodoWrite tool with all parsed tasks and their IDs

3. **Context Acquisition**:
   - Read the relevant files mentioned in the spec to load initial context
   - **MCP Enhancement**: Use static-analysis MCP tools for TypeScript files when available
   - Analyze existing patterns and conventions

4. **Acknowledge**: 
   specgen-engineer mode implementation command - Specification loaded from specgen MCP, implementation ready to begin
   
   "specgen-engineer, I have loaded specification `[Spec Title]` (ID: [spec_id], Category: [feature_group]) from specgen MCP and created a todo list of [X] tasks. Found [Y] related specifications in the same category for context. I am ready to begin implementation, starting with the `[First Layer Name]`."

### PHASE 2: LAYER-BY-LAYER EXECUTION

**Protocol**:
Execute all tasks for one layer (e.g., Database) before moving to the next, following the order in the implementation plan. The major layers are - DATABASE, BACKEND, FRONTEND, INTEGRATION & TESTING. Some additional layers may be defined by the architect.

1. **Start Layer**: "Now starting the `[Layer Name]` layer."

2. **Execute Tasks in Layer**:
   For each task in the current layer's group:
   - **Announce Task**: "Executing task `[TASK-ID]`: `[TASK_DESCRIPTION]`."
   - **Pre-Implementation Analysis**:
     <thinking>
     - What files do I need to read/modify for this specific task?
     - What is the minimal change required?
     - How does this fit with the previous tasks in this layer?
     - Can I use static-analysis MCP tools to better understand the codebase?
     </thinking>
   - **MCP-Enhanced Implementation**:
     - Use `mcp__static-analysis__analyze_file` for understanding TypeScript files
     - Use `mcp__static-analysis__find_references` for symbol usage analysis
     - Apply the code changes as described
   - **Update Task Status**: Mark the current task as complete in your internal todo list
   - **Handle Failure**: If a task fails, log the failure immediately (see PHASE 3 format) and **stop all execution**. Await user intervention.

3. **Log Layer Progress**: Once all tasks in the current layer are successfully completed, proceed to **PHASE 3**.

### PHASE 3: MCP PROGRESS LOGGING BY LAYER

**Trigger**: This phase is executed after all tasks in a logical layer are completed successfully.

**MCP Logging Protocol**:
Update the specification in specgen MCP with execution progress by appending to the specification content with proper H2 headers for dashboard parsing.

**Log Entry Creation**:
Retrieve current specification, append new log entry, then update:

```xml
<mcp-update-spec>
ID: [spec_id]
Content: [Original content + new log entry]
Status: in-progress
</mcp-update-spec>
```

**Log Entry Format**:
```markdown
## Execution Logs

### Layer Completed: [Layer Name - e.g., Database Layer]
- **Status**: Completed
- **Timestamp**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - `[TASK-ID]`: [Task Description]
  - `[TASK-ID]`: [Task Description]
- **Summary**: [Brief summary of what was accomplished in this layer, e.g., "Database migrations created and schema updated."]
- **MCP Tools Used**: [List any static-analysis tools used for enhanced implementation]
```

**If a failure occurred, the log entry should be:**
```markdown
## Debug Logs

### Task Failed: [TASK-ID] - [Task Description]
- **Status**: Failed
- **Timestamp**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- **Layer**: [Layer Name]
- **Error**: [Paste the exact error message.]
- **Context**: [Any relevant MCP analysis that was being performed]
```

### PHASE 4: SESSION COMPLETION

**Trigger**: Reached when all layers in the implementation plan are completed successfully.

1. **Final MCP Update**: Update specification status to "done"
   ```xml
   <mcp-update-spec>
   ID: [spec_id]
   Status: done
   </mcp-update-spec>
   ```

2. **Final Summary**: 
   ðŸ”” specgen_ENGINEER_COMPLETE: Implementation finished successfully - All layers executed using specgen MCP, feature implementation complete
   
   "specgen-engineer, the implementation for `[Feature Name]` is complete. All layers from specification ID [spec_id] have been executed and logged successfully in specgen MCP."

---

## MODE: DEBUG

This mode is triggered when the user invokes the command with `mode: 'debug'`.

### PHASE 1: DEBUG CONTEXT LOADING

1. **Load Full MCP Context**: 
   ```xml
   <mcp-get-spec>
   ID: [spec_identifier]
   Include-Relations: true
   </mcp-get-spec>
   ```
   Retrieve the entire specification including the original content, implementation plan, and full execution logs.

2. **Identify Failure Point**: Analyze the logs to understand which task failed and what the reported error was.

3. **MCP-Enhanced Analysis**: Use static-analysis MCP tools to understand the failure context:
   - Analyze files related to the failed task
   - Check for compilation errors in the affected area
   - Find references to understand impact

4. **Acknowledge**: 
   specgen-engineer debug mode activated - Analyzing failure context using specgen MCP and preparing resolution strategy
   
   "specgen-engineer, I have loaded the full context for specification ID [spec_id] from specgen MCP. I am now analyzing the failure in task `[TASK-ID]` based on your description: `[issue_description]`."

### PHASE 2: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Internal Monologue**:
<thinking>
- **MCP Log Analysis**: What does the error in the SpecGen MCP execution log tell me?
- **Code Analysis**: Let me re-read the code related to the failed task and the original spec. Did I interpret the requirements correctly?
- **Static Analysis Enhancement**: Can I use mcp__static-analysis tools to get better insight into the failure?
- **Hypothesis Generation**:
    - Hypothesis 1 (Code Error): Is there a flaw in the implemented code?
    - Hypothesis 2 (Context Error): Did I misunderstand the existing codebase?
    - Hypothesis 3 (Dependency Error): Is there an external factor I missed?
- **Evidence Gathering**: I will trace the logic and re-examine the files to confirm my hypothesis.
</thinking>

### PHASE 3: PROPOSE & IMPLEMENT FIX

1. **Propose Solution**:
   > **Root Cause**: [A clear explanation of the underlying problem.]
   > **Proposed Fix**: [A detailed description of the changes needed.]
   > **MCP Analysis**: [Any insights from static-analysis tools that informed the solution.]
   > ðŸ”” APPROVAL_REQUEST: User approval required before proceeding with implementation changes
   > "specgen-engineer, I have analyzed the issue using MCP tools. Here is my proposal. Awaiting your confirmation to proceed."

2. **Implement Fix**: Upon user approval, apply the changes using both traditional tools and MCP enhancements.

### PHASE 4: DEBUG LOGGING

1. **Append Debug Log to MCP**: After implementing the fix, update the specification in SpecGen MCP:
   
   ```xml
   <mcp-update-spec>
   ID: [spec_id]
   Content: [Original content + debug log entry]
   </mcp-update-spec>
   ```
   
   **Debug Log Format**:
   ```markdown
   ## Debug Logs
   
   ### Debug Session: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
   - **Issue**: Task `[TASK-ID]` failed with error: `[Error Message]`.
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: [Summary of the analysis and identified cause.]
   - **MCP Tools Used**: [List static-analysis or other MCP tools used in diagnosis.]
   - **Resolution**: [Description of the fix that was implemented.]
   - **Status**: Resolved / Unresolved.
   ```

2. **Notify**: 
   ðŸ”” specgen_DEBUG_COMPLETE: Issue analysis and resolution complete using specgen MCP - Debug session finished successfully
   
   "specgen-engineer, the debug session is complete. The results have been logged to specgen MCP specification ID [spec_id]."
