# macOS Notification System Technical Specification

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive technical specification for implementing macOS notification capabilities and voice synthesis options for the Claude Code workflow system.

## macOS Notification System (`osascript`)

### Basic Notification Syntax

```bash
osascript -e 'display notification "MESSAGE" with title "TITLE" [subtitle "SUBTITLE"] [sound name "SOUND"]'
```

### Available Parameters

- **`notification`**: The main message text (required)
- **`title`**: The notification title (optional, defaults to app name)
- **`subtitle`**: Additional descriptive text (optional)
- **`sound name`**: System sound to play (optional)

### System Sound Options

Available system sounds located in `/System/Library/Sounds/`:

| Sound Name | Use Case | Characteristics |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| `Ping` | Permission waiting, alerts | Sharp, attention-grabbing |
| `Purr` | Success, completion | Gentle, pleasant |
| `Hero` | Task completion, achievements | Triumphant, satisfying |
| `Glass` | Information, updates | Clean, neutral |
| `Blow` | General notifications | Moderate, balanced |
| `Basso` | Errors, warnings | Deep, serious |
| `Funk` | Playful notifications | Upbeat, casual |
| `Tink` | Subtle alerts | Soft, unobtrusive |
| `Sosumi` | Classic Mac sound | Nostalgic, recognizable |
| `Submarine` | System events | Unique, distinctive |

### Notification Behavior

- **Persistence**: Notifications appear in macOS Notification Center and auto-dismiss after ~5 seconds
- **Timing**: Immediate display, no built-in delay mechanisms
- **User Interaction**: Click to dismiss, no custom action buttons in basic notifications

## Voice Synthesis System (`say`)

### Samantha Voice Specifications

```bash
say -v Samantha "MESSAGE"
```

**Voice Profile:**
- **Language**: English (US)
- **Gender**: Female
- **Quality**: High-quality, natural-sounding
- **Availability**: Pre-installed on macOS

### Voice Control Options

```bash
say -v Samantha -r [RATE] "MESSAGE"
```

**Rate Settings:**
- **Default**: ~175 words per minute
- **Slow**: 120-150 wpm (better for complex messages)
- **Standard**: 150-200 wpm (recommended for notifications)
- **Fast**: 200-250 wpm (brief alerts)

### Alternative Voice Options

| Voice | Characteristics | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `Alex` | Default male voice | General purpose |
| `Victoria` | British female | Formal notifications |
| `Fred` | Casual male | Friendly alerts |
| `Whisper` | Soft, quiet | Subtle notifications |
| `Good News` | Upbeat tone | Success messages |
| `Bad News` | Serious tone | Error messages |

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Permission Waiting Notifications

```bash
# Visual + Audio
osascript -e 'display notification "Waiting for user permission..." with title "Claude Code" subtitle "Please check your terminal" sound name "Ping"'

# No voice synthesis (avoid interruption)
```

**Rationale:**
- `Ping` sound is attention-grabbing but not intrusive
- Subtitle provides context
- No voice to avoid interrupting user workflow

### 2. Idle Session Notifications

```bash
# Visual notification
osascript -e 'display notification "Session has been idle for 5 minutes" with title "Claude Code" sound name "Tink"'

# Optional gentle voice reminder
say -v Samantha -r 150 "Session idle"
```

**Rationale:**
- `Tink` is subtle and non-disruptive
- Slow voice rate for better comprehension
- Brief message to avoid annoyance

### 3. Task Completion Notifications

```bash
# Visual notification
osascript -e 'display notification "Task completed successfully" with title "Claude Code" subtitle "3 files modified" sound name "Hero"'

# Voice notification with Samantha
say -v Samantha -r 175 "Task completed successfully"
```

**Rationale:**
- `Hero` sound conveys achievement
- Samantha voice provides pleasant feedback
- Standard rate for clear communication
- Subtitle provides specific details

## Advanced Implementation Patterns

### Conditional Notifications

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TASK_TYPE="$1"
MESSAGE="$2"
DETAILS="$3"

case "$TASK_TYPE" in
    "permission")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Ping\""
        ;;
    "completion")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" subtitle \"${DETAILS}\" sound name \"Hero\""
        say -v Samantha -r 175 "${MESSAGE}"
        ;;
    "error")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Basso\""
        say -v Samantha -r 150 "Error: ${MESSAGE}"
        ;;
    "idle")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Tink\""
        ;;
esac
```

### Notification Queue Management

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent notification spam
LAST_NOTIFICATION_FILE="/tmp/claude_last_notification"
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)

if [ -f "$LAST_NOTIFICATION_FILE" ]; then
    LAST_TIME=$(cat "$LAST_NOTIFICATION_FILE")
    TIME_DIFF=$((CURRENT_TIME - LAST_TIME))
    
    # Minimum 2 seconds between notifications
    if [ $TIME_DIFF -lt 2 ]; then
        exit 0
    fi
fi

echo "$CURRENT_TIME" > "$LAST_NOTIFICATION_FILE"
# Proceed with notification...
```

## User Experience Best Practices

### Timing Guidelines

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Show notifications within 100ms of task completion
2. **Debouncing**: Minimum 2-second gap between notifications
3. **Session Management**: Reduce notification frequency during active sessions

### Sound Selection Guidelines

1. **Success**: `Hero`, `Purr` - positive, rewarding sounds
2. **Attention**: `Ping`, `Glass` - clear, attention-grabbing
3. **Errors**: `Basso` - serious, distinctive
4. **Subtle**: `Tink` - gentle, non-disruptive

### Voice Synthesis Guidelines

1. **Completion Messages**: Use Samantha voice at 175 wpm
2. **Error Messages**: Use Samantha voice at 150 wpm for clarity
3. **Keep Messages Brief**: Maximum 10 words for voice notifications
4. **Avoid Interruption**: No voice for permission/waiting states

## Integration with Claude Code Hooks

### Enhanced notification.sh Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
MESSAGE="$1"
TASK_TYPE="$2"
DETAILS="$3"

# Summarize message if too long
if [ ${#MESSAGE} -gt 50 ]; then
    MESSAGE=$(echo "$MESSAGE" | head -c 50)...
fi

# Apply notification strategy based on task type
case "$TASK_TYPE" in
    "completion")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" subtitle \"${DETAILS}\" sound name \"Hero\""
        say -v Samantha -r 175 "Task completed"
        ;;
    "edit")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Purr\""
        say -v Samantha -r 175 "Edit completed"
        ;;
    "error")
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Basso\""
        say -v Samantha -r 150 "Error occurred"
        ;;
    *)
        osascript -e "display notification \"${MESSAGE}\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Glass\""
        ;;
esac
```

### Integration with ~/.claude/settings.json

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command // \\\"\\\") - \\(.tool_input.description // \\\"\\\") - \\(.tool_response.stdout // \\\"\\\") - \\(.tool_response.content // \\\"\\\")\"' | notification.sh completion"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Sanitization**: Always escape shell special characters in notification messages
2. **Sound Volume**: Respect system volume settings (sounds use system volume)
3. **Notification Permissions**: Ensure Terminal.app has notification permissions
4. **Resource Usage**: Voice synthesis can be CPU-intensive; use judiciously

## Testing and Validation

### Test Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Testing notification system..."

# Test basic notification
osascript -e 'display notification "Test message" with title "Test" sound name "Ping"'

# Test Samantha voice
say -v Samantha "Testing voice synthesis"

# Test notification with subtitle
osascript -e 'display notification "Main message" with title "Test" subtitle "Additional info" sound name "Hero"'

echo "Testing complete"
```

This specification provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing macOS notifications with optimal user experience and technical reliability.

## Debug Log

### Debug Session: 2025-07-14 23:24:00

#### Issue Description
- **Problem**: Notification sounds not audible for both completion and permission events despite successful osascript execution
- **User Report**: "I am unable to hear sounds right now for completion, can you debug; not am I hearing sounds for permissions"
- **Initial Hypothesis**: System notification settings or macOS permissions issue

#### Investigation Process

**Phase 1: Initial Diagnostics**
- System requirements check: ✅ PASSED
- Hook configuration check: ✅ PASSED
- Manual osascript test: ✅ PASSED (commands executed successfully)
- System volume settings: Alert volume at 100%

**Phase 2: Context Analysis**
- Key insight: Sounds worked in manual tests but failed in actual hook execution
- Enhanced logging revealed: osascript commands returned success (0) but sounds were silent
- Environment comparison: Hook execution vs direct execution contexts identical

**Phase 3: Root Cause Discovery**
- **Error masking issue**: Original code used `2>/dev/null` hiding potential errors
- **Silent failure**: osascript `sound name` parameter was being ignored by macOS
- **Process context**: Background hook execution lacked audio session access

#### Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/hooks/notification.sh`: Enhanced error logging and fallback system
- `.claude/hooks/utilities/audio-diagnostics.sh`: New diagnostic tool

**Key Changes:**
1. **Enhanced Error Logging**:
   ```bash
   # Before: osascript ... 2>/dev/null
   # After: OSASCRIPT_OUTPUT=$(osascript ... 2>&1)
   ```

2. **Fallback Sound System**:
   ```bash
   # Added after successful osascript execution
   SOUND_FILE="/System/Library/Sounds/${SOUND_NAME}.aiff"
   afplay "$SOUND_FILE" 2>/dev/null &
   ```

3. **Environment Debugging**:
   ```bash
   log_debug "Environment context - USER: $USER, PPID: $PPID"
   log_debug "Process tree: $(ps -o pid,ppid,command -p $$)"
   ```

#### Test Results

**Before Fix:**
- Banner notifications: ✅ Visible
- osascript return code: 0 (success)
- Sound playback: ❌ Silent
- Voice synthesis: ✅ Working

**After Fix:**
- Banner notifications: ✅ Visible
- osascript return code: 0 (success)
- Fallback sound playback: ✅ Audible (afplay with PID tracking)
- Voice synthesis: ✅ Working

#### Validation Tests

**PostToolUse Event:**
```
[2025-07-14 23:22:44] Banner notification successful
[2025-07-14 23:22:44] Playing fallback sound: Hero
[2025-07-14 23:22:44] Sound playback started with PID: 30820
[2025-07-14 23:22:44] Voice synthesis successful
```

**Notification Event:**
```
[2025-07-14 23:23:15] Banner notification successful
[2025-07-14 23:23:15] Playing fallback sound: Ping
[2025-07-14 23:23:15] Sound playback started with PID: 30903
[2025-07-14 23:23:15] Voice synthesis skipped (correct behavior)
```

#### Diagnostic Tools Created

**Audio Diagnostics Script**: `.claude/hooks/utilities/audio-diagnostics.sh`
- Tests sound execution in different contexts
- Validates system audio requirements  
- Provides comprehensive environment logging
- Available for future troubleshooting

#### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **not** related to:
- System notification settings
- macOS permissions
- Audio device configuration
- Process execution context

The issue **was** caused by:
- macOS silently ignoring osascript `sound name` parameter in hook execution context
- Background processes lacking reliable audio session access for notification sounds
- Error masking preventing visibility into the actual failure

#### Resolution Strategy
**Primary Fix**: Implemented `afplay` fallback system that directly plays system sound files
**Secondary Fix**: Enhanced error logging and debugging capabilities
**Tertiary Fix**: Added comprehensive diagnostic tools for future issues

#### Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- Both PostToolUse (Hero sound) and Notification (Ping sound) events now produce audible sounds
- Enhanced debugging provides full visibility into notification system behavior
- Fallback mechanisms ensure reliable sound playback regardless of osascript behavior
- Comprehensive diagnostic tools available for future troubleshooting

### Debug Session: 2025-07-14 23:38:00

#### Issue Description
- **Problem**: Edit operations (documentation updates) were not triggering notification sounds
- **User Report**: "see it did not play sound for the documentation update just now; can you think hard and fix it"
- **Context**: Previous debug session fixed general notification sounds, but Edit operations were still silent

#### Investigation Process

**Phase 1: Log Analysis**
- Checked recent notification logs: No Edit operations found in logs
- Examined PostToolUse debug files: No files being created for Edit operations
- Identified that hooks weren't triggering for Edit operations at all

**Phase 2: Configuration Analysis**
- Hook configuration included `"matcher": "Bash|Edit|MultiEdit|Write"` ✅
- Configuration was located in `.claude/hooks/settings.json`
- Claude Code was reading from `.claude/settings.local.json`
- **Root Cause**: Hooks configured in wrong settings file

**Phase 3: Fix Implementation**
- Merged hooks configuration from `.claude/hooks/settings.json` into `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Added complete PostToolUse and Notification hook configurations to main settings file

#### Technical Resolution

**Configuration Fix:**
```json
{
  "permissions": { ... },
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cat > ~/.claude/debug/notifications/last-posttooluse-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).json"
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/notification.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

#### Validation Results

**Test Edit Operation (23:36:21):**
```
[2025-07-14 23:36:21] Event type detected: PostToolUse
[2025-07-14 23:36:25] PostToolUse processed - Tool: Edit, Voice: "Edit:   "
[2025-07-14 23:36:25] Banner notification successful
[2025-07-14 23:36:25] Playing fallback sound: Hero
[2025-07-14 23:36:25] Sound playback started with PID: 33453
[2025-07-14 23:36:29] Voice synthesis successful
```

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED**
- Edit operations now trigger notification sounds consistently
- All tool operations (Bash, Edit, MultiEdit, Write) generate appropriate notifications
- Hook configuration properly located in main settings file
