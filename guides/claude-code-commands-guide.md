# The Claude Code Command Arsenal

*Five commands that turned me from a chaotic coder into a systematic developer*

Listen, I used to be that developer. You know the type - start coding immediately, Google errors as they come, spend hours debugging something that could've been planned in 15 minutes. Then I discovered Claude Code's command system, and honestly? It changed everything.

## The Reality Check

Before these commands, my workflow looked like this:
- **Monday**: "I'll quickly add user auth" → **Friday**: Still debugging OAuth edge cases
- Start coding without specs → Realize I'm building the wrong thing → Rebuild everything
- Find bugs in production → Spend weekends fixing what should've been caught in development
- Code reviews that were basically "looks good to me" because nobody had time to really dig in

After mastering these 5 commands? I ship features faster, with fewer bugs, and actually sleep well at night.

## The Five Game-Changers

### `/architect` - The Brain Dump Transformer

**What it actually does**: Takes your messy feature idea and turns it into a crystal-clear implementation plan

**When I use it**: Every single time I think "we need to add..." or "users want..."

**Real example from last week**:
- **My brain dump**: "We need some kind of notification system so users know when stuff happens"
- **What `/architect` gave me**: 47-page specification with database schema, API endpoints, WebSocket implementation, email templates, and a 23-task implementation roadmap

**The magic moment**: When `/architect` asks clarification questions I never thought of:
- "Should notifications be real-time via WebSockets or polling?"
- "How long should notification history be stored?"
- "What happens when a user has 1000+ unread notifications?"

**Time investment**: 45-90 minutes of back-and-forth
**Time saved**: Literally weeks of building the wrong thing

```bash
# My actual usage pattern
/architect "Add real-time collaboration to our document editor"
# → Gets me a complete spec with operational transforms, conflict resolution, presence indicators
```

### `/engineer` - The Systematic Builder

**What it actually does**: Takes your spec and implements it layer by layer, documenting everything

**Why I love it**: No more "where did I leave off?" or "what was I building again?"

**The layer system** (this is genius):
1. **Database** - Schema changes first, always
2. **Backend** - Services and business logic
3. **API** - REST endpoints that actually make sense
4. **Frontend** - Components that use the API correctly
5. **Integration** - End-to-end flows that actually work
6. **Testing** - Because future-me will thank present-me

**Real debugging story**: Last month, payment processing was randomly failing in production. Traditional me would've spent hours adding console.logs everywhere. Instead:

```bash
/engineer docs/SPEC-payment-system.md debug "Stripe webhooks failing with 401 errors"
```

**What it found**: Webhook signature validation was using development keys in production. Took 10 minutes to identify and fix.

**Progress tracking** is addictive:
```markdown
### Layer Completed: Backend Services
- Status: Completed ✅
- Tasks: BE-001 (Auth service), BE-002 (Payment service)
- Summary: All services implement proper error handling and logging
```

### `/reviewer` - The Quality Guardian

**Three modes that saved my career**:

**Security mode** - Because data breaches ruin lives:
- Found SQL injection in my "perfectly safe" search feature
- Caught me logging credit card numbers to console (yes, really)
- Identified 12 npm packages with known vulnerabilities

**Quality mode** - For when "it works on my machine" isn't enough:
- Showed me 23 React components without error boundaries
- Found memory leaks in WebSocket connections
- Identified test coverage gaps in authentication logic

**Performance mode** - Before your users start complaining:
- Caught N+1 queries that would've killed production
- Found bundle bloat from importing entire lodash library
- Identified missing database indexes on frequently queried columns

**My monthly ritual**:
```bash
# Before any major release
/reviewer security "comprehensive security audit before launch"
/reviewer performance "identify optimization opportunities"
```

**Results**: Haven't had a security incident in 8 months, page load times under 1 second

### `/user` - The Reality Check

**What it actually does**: Tests your app like a real user (not like a developer who knows all the edge cases)

**The eye-opener**: I thought my checkout flow was perfect. `/user` found:
- Add to cart button gave zero visual feedback
- Mobile users couldn't reach the checkout button (below the fold)
- Payment form accepted obviously fake credit card numbers
- Success page looked like an error to users

**Typical session**:
```bash
/user "complete a purchase as a first-time customer on mobile"
```

**What I get**: Screenshots of every step, documented friction points, technical bugs, and a UX rating

**The brutal honesty I needed**:
- "User abandoned cart - no progress indicator during 8-second load"
- "User clicked 'Buy Now' 4 times - no loading state shown"
- "User confusion: 'Is my order confirmed or not?'"

**Mobile testing revelation**: 34% of my users are mobile-only. `/user` made sure my app actually worked for them.

### `/analyst` - The Data Whisperer

**What I use it for**:
- **Generate realistic test data**: "Create 10,000 users with realistic purchase patterns"
- **Performance analysis**: "Find the slowest database queries in user management"
- **Business insights**: "Analyze user engagement patterns for feature prioritization"

**Game-changing moment**: Instead of testing with 3 users named "Test User", I now have thousands of realistic users with:
- Proper names from different cultures
- Realistic email patterns
- Believable purchase histories
- Geographic distribution

**Database optimization win**: `/analyst` found that user search was scanning 2M rows on every query. Added two indexes, went from 3-second searches to 50ms.

```bash
# My weekly performance check
/analyst "identify database performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities"
```

## How They Work Together (The Magic)

### The Complete Feature Cycle

**Week 1**: Product asks for "better user engagement"
```bash
/architect "user engagement system with personalized recommendations and activity feeds"
```
Result: 67-page spec with recommendation algorithms, feed generation, real-time updates

**Week 2-3**: Implementation
```bash
/engineer docs/SPEC-engagement-system.md
# When bugs happen:
/engineer docs/SPEC-engagement-system.md debug "recommendation engine returning duplicate items"
```

**Week 4**: Quality assurance
```bash
/reviewer security "audit recommendation system for data privacy"
/reviewer performance "optimize feed generation for 100k+ users"
/user "test personalized recommendations and activity feed experience"
```

**Launch**: Confidence level = maximum

### The Emergency Bug Fix Flow

**Friday 4 PM**: Production is slow, users complaining

**Old me**: Panic, add random indexes, hope for the best

**New me**:
```bash
/analyst "identify performance bottlenecks in production database"
# → Finds specific slow queries

/reviewer performance "analyze database optimization opportunities"  
# → Gets optimization plan

/engineer docs/emergency-performance-fix.md
# → Implements fixes systematically
```

**Result**: Issue fixed in 2 hours instead of ruining my weekend

## The Patterns That Actually Work

### For New Features (The Standard Flow)
1. **Start messy**: Brain dump your idea to `/architect`
2. **Get specific**: Answer the clarification questions honestly
3. **Build systematically**: Use `/engineer` to implement layer by layer
4. **Quality check**: Run `/reviewer` in appropriate mode
5. **User test**: Validate with `/user` before launch

### For Bug Fixes (The Systematic Approach)
1. **Reproduce**: Use `/user` to understand the user experience
2. **Diagnose**: Use `/engineer debug` for systematic analysis
3. **Verify**: Use `/reviewer` to ensure fix doesn't break other things

### For Performance Issues (The Data-Driven Fix)
1. **Measure**: Use `/analyst` to identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Plan**: Use `/architect` for complex optimization projects
3. **Optimize**: Use `/engineer` to implement changes
4. **Validate**: Use `/reviewer performance` to confirm improvements

## The Mindset Shift

### Before Claude Code Commands
- **Planning**: "I'll figure it out as I go"
- **Implementation**: "Let me just start coding"
- **Testing**: "It works on my machine"
- **Debugging**: "Add more console.logs"
- **Quality**: "Looks good to me"

### After Claude Code Commands
- **Planning**: "Let me think through this properly first"
- **Implementation**: "Follow the spec, layer by layer"
- **Testing**: "How would a real user experience this?"
- **Debugging**: "What does the evidence tell me?"
- **Quality**: "What could go wrong in production?"

## Quick Wins to Start Today

### If you have 30 minutes:
Pick your most annoying bug and run:
```bash
/engineer debug "describe the actual bug you're seeing"
```

### If you have 1 hour:
Take a feature request and run:
```bash
/architect "paste the feature request here"
```
Don't implement it, just see how thorough the planning becomes.

### If you have 2 hours:
Test your app with real user behavior:
```bash
/user "complete your app's most important user journey"
```
Prepare to be humbled.

## Command Selection Cheat Sheet

**When starting something new**: Always `/architect` first
**When building**: Always `/engineer` with a spec
**When stuck on a bug**: Always `/engineer debug`
**Before shipping**: Always `/reviewer` in appropriate mode
**When users complain**: Always `/user` to understand their experience
**When performance sucks**: Always `/analyst` to find the real bottlenecks

**The golden rule**: Trust the process. Your instinct to "just quickly fix this" is usually wrong.
