# Unified Debug Workflow: Engineer Mode + Hook System + Advanced Troubleshooting

*A comprehensive methodology combining engineer debug mode, hook system monitoring, and systematic troubleshooting*

## Introduction: The Debug Trinity

Debugging in Claude Code isn't just about fixing errors—it's about building a comprehensive understanding of your system through three integrated approaches:

1. **Engineer Debug Mode**: Systematic root cause analysis with full specification context
2. **Hook System Intelligence**: Real-time monitoring and session context accumulation  
3. **Advanced Troubleshooting**: Pattern recognition and preventive debugging strategies

This guide shows you how to orchestrate these three approaches into a unified debugging methodology that transforms problems into learning opportunities.

## Part 1: The Unified Debug Philosophy

### Traditional Debugging vs. Claude Code Unified Approach

**Traditional Debugging:**
```
Error occurs → Google/StackOverflow → Try random fixes → Hope it works
```

**Claude Code Unified Debug:**
```
Error occurs → Hook system captures context → Engineer debug analyzes systematically → Pattern recognition prevents recurrence
```

### The Debug Information Hierarchy

#### Level 1: Immediate Context (Engineer Debug Mode)
- Current implementation state
- Recent changes leading to the issue
- Error messages and stack traces
- Related code context

#### Level 2: Session Intelligence (Hook System)
- Complete development session history
- Sequence of all tool uses and modifications
- Pattern recognition across similar issues
- AI-generated session insights

#### Level 3: Historical Patterns (Advanced Analysis)
- Cross-session issue patterns
- Team debugging knowledge base
- Preventive debugging strategies
- Long-term system health metrics

---

## Part 2: The Unified Debug Workflow

### Step 1: Immediate Issue Detection

When an issue occurs, the hook system immediately captures context:

```bash
# Hook system automatically logs the error
[2025-01-19 15:42:33] PostToolUse: ERROR DETECTED
Tool: Bash
Command: npm test
Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
Context: Running tests after authentication service changes
```

**Immediate Actions:**
- Hook system provides audio alert
- Error context is logged with full session history
- Session intelligence starts accumulating debug information

### Step 2: Engineer Debug Mode Activation

Activate systematic analysis with full context:

```bash
@engineer.md docs/SPEC-authentication-system.md debug "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined in authentication service tests"
```

**Engineer Debug Analysis Process:**

#### Phase 1: Context Integration
```
ENGINEER: "I have loaded the full context including:
- Original authentication service specification
- Complete implementation history from execution logs  
- Hook system session data showing sequence of changes
- Current error context and test failure details"
```

#### Phase 2: Multi-Layer Analysis
Engineer debug mode analyzes multiple layers simultaneously:

**Code Analysis:**
- Reviews recent implementation changes
- Identifies potential null/undefined value sources
- Analyzes test setup and data dependencies

**Session Context Analysis:**
- Reviews hook system logs for change sequence
- Identifies patterns from recent modifications
- Correlates timing of changes with error occurrence

**Specification Alignment:**
- Verifies implementation matches original spec
- Identifies deviations that might cause issues
- Suggests spec updates if requirements changed

#### Phase 3: Root Cause Hypothesis
```
<thinking>
Hook system shows authentication service was modified 23 minutes ago.
Test failure started after user profile validation changes.
Error location suggests array method called on undefined value.
Hypothesis: User profile data structure changed but tests not updated.
</thinking>
```

### Step 3: Intelligent Solution Synthesis

Engineer debug mode synthesizes information from all sources:

**Root Cause**: User profile data structure modified during implementation, but test fixtures still expect old structure where `profile.permissions` was an array.

**Evidence from Hook System**: Session context shows `UserProfile.ts` was modified to use `profile.roles` object instead of `profile.permissions` array, but test files weren't updated.

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Update test fixtures to use new `profile.roles` structure
2. Modify authentication service tests to handle object instead of array
3. Add type checking to prevent similar issues

### Step 4: Implementation and Knowledge Capture

```bash
# Engineer debug mode implements fix
# Hook system captures the resolution
# Session intelligence learns the pattern
```

**Knowledge Capture Example:**
```markdown
### Debug Session: 2025-01-19 15:45:32
- **Issue**: TypeError in authentication tests after profile structure change
- **Root Cause**: Test fixtures not updated when data structure changed from array to object
- **Pattern**: Data structure changes require coordinated test updates
- **Prevention**: Add pre-commit hook to verify test/code alignment
- **Resolution**: Updated test fixtures and added type checking
- **Learning**: When modifying data structures, always update tests in same commit
```

## Part 3: Advanced Debug Patterns

### Pattern 1: Cross-Session Issue Correlation

When the hook system detects similar errors across sessions:

```bash
# Hook system analysis
[2025-01-19] Similar error pattern detected:
- 3 authentication-related TypeErrors in past week
- All occurred after data structure modifications  
- Pattern: Tests not updated with schema changes

Auto-suggestion: Consider implementing schema-test validation
```

**Unified Response:**
1. **Engineer Debug**: Analyzes current specific issue
2. **Hook Intelligence**: Provides historical context and patterns
3. **Prevention Strategy**: Suggests systematic improvements

### Pattern 2: Integration Debug Workflows

For complex issues spanning multiple systems:

```bash
@engineer.md docs/SPEC-payment-integration.md debug "Stripe webhook validation intermittently failing in production"
```

**Multi-System Analysis:**
```
ENGINEER: "Analyzing payment integration issue with context from:
- Payment service implementation logs
- Webhook configuration changes (from hook system)
- Production environment differences
- Recent deployment history (from session intelligence)"
```

**Hook System Contribution:**
- Provides timeline of all payment-related changes
- Identifies correlation with recent environment updates
- Shows pattern of webhook failures after specific deployments

### Pattern 3: Performance Debug Integration

For performance-related issues:

```bash
@engineer.md docs/SPEC-dashboard-optimization.md debug "Dashboard loading times increased after recent data service changes"
```

**Performance Debug Process:**
1. **Engineer Analysis**: Reviews data service implementation changes
2. **Hook Intelligence**: Provides timeline of performance-impacting modifications
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar performance regressions from past sessions

**Hook System Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Enhanced hook for performance tracking
"PostToolUse")
    # Detect performance-sensitive changes
    if echo "$INPUT" | grep -E "(database|query|cache|index)" >/dev/null; then
        echo "[$TIMESTAMP] PERFORMANCE_WATCH: $(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name') - $(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // "N/A"')" >> "$PERFORMANCE_LOG"
        
        # Alert for multiple performance changes in short time
        RECENT_CHANGES=$(tail -20 "$PERFORMANCE_LOG" | grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" | wc -l)
        if [ "$RECENT_CHANGES" -gt 5 ]; then
            say -v Samantha -r 175 "Multiple performance-sensitive changes detected" &
        fi
    fi
    ;;
```

---

## Part 4: Team Debug Collaboration

### Shared Debug Context

When team members collaborate on debugging:

```bash
# Team member A encounters issue
@engineer.md docs/SPEC-api-service.md debug "API endpoints returning 500 after deployment"

# Hook system logs to shared location
echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Team Debug Session Started: API 500 errors - Member: $(whoami)" >> "/shared/debug-sessions.log"

# Team member B continues investigation
@engineer.md docs/SPEC-api-service.md debug "Continuing API 500 investigation from team member A's analysis"
```

**Collaborative Benefits:**
- Shared hook system logs provide team context
- Engineer debug mode builds on previous analysis
- Knowledge accumulation prevents duplicate investigation

### Cross-Team Pattern Sharing

```bash
# Hook system pattern detection across teams
"Stop")
    # Share successful debug patterns
    if grep -q "DEBUG_SUCCESS" "$LOG_FILE"; then
        DEBUG_PATTERN=$(grep "Root Cause:" "$LOG_FILE" | tail -1)
        echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Team Pattern: $DEBUG_PATTERN" >> "/shared/debug-patterns.log"
    fi
    ;;
```

---

## Part 5: Preventive Debug Strategies

### Early Warning Systems

Hook system can detect potential issues before they become problems:

```bash
# Preventive monitoring hooks
"PostToolUse")
    TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
    FILE_PATH=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // ""')
    
    # Detect risky patterns
    case "$TOOL_NAME" in
        "Edit"|"MultiEdit")
            # Check for common anti-patterns
            if echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "console.log\\|TODO\\|FIXME\\|hack"; then
                echo "[$TIMESTAMP] WARNING: Temporary code detected in $FILE_PATH" >> "$LOG_FILE"
                say -v Samantha -r 175 "Temporary code detected" &
            fi
            
            # Check for potential null pointer issues
            if echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "\\.length\\|\\.map\\|\\.filter" && ! echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "null\\|undefined"; then
                echo "[$TIMESTAMP] CAUTION: Array operations without null checking in $FILE_PATH" >> "$LOG_FILE"
            fi
            ;;
    esac
    ;;
```

### Learning Pattern Recognition

```bash
# Pattern learning from successful resolutions
"Stop")
    # Extract successful debug patterns
    if [ -f "$SESSION_CONTEXT_FILE" ]; then
        # Look for debug sessions that were resolved
        if grep -q "Root Cause.*Resolution" "$SESSION_CONTEXT_FILE"; then
            # Extract the pattern for future reference
            PATTERN=$(grep -A 2 "Root Cause:" "$SESSION_CONTEXT_FILE" | tr '\n' ' ')
            echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Learned Pattern: $PATTERN" >> "$DEBUG_PATTERNS_FILE"
        fi
    fi
    ;;
```

## Part 6: Debug Quality Metrics

### Success Tracking

Monitor debug effectiveness across sessions:

```json
{
  "debug_metrics": {
    "session_id": "uuid",
    "issue_type": "TypeError",
    "resolution_time": 1247,
    "tools_used": ["engineer_debug", "hook_analysis", "manual_investigation"],
    "root_cause_accuracy": "confirmed",
    "prevention_added": true,
    "knowledge_captured": true
  }
}
```

### Pattern Effectiveness Analysis

```bash
# Analyze debug pattern success rates
"Stop")
    if grep -q "DEBUG_SUCCESS" "$LOG_FILE"; then
        RESOLUTION_TIME=$(grep "Resolution.*:" "$LOG_FILE" | grep -o "[0-9]*" | tail -1)
        ROOT_CAUSE=$(grep "Root Cause:" "$LOG_FILE" | sed 's/.*Root Cause: //')
        
        # Update pattern success database
        echo "{\"timestamp\":\"$(date -Iseconds)\",\"resolution_time\":$RESOLUTION_TIME,\"root_cause\":\"$ROOT_CAUSE\",\"success\":true}" >> "$DEBUG_ANALYTICS_FILE"
    fi
    ;;
```

## Part 7: Integration with Development Workflow

### Continuous Integration Debug

Hook system integration with CI/CD for automatic issue detection:

```bash
# CI/CD integration hook
"PostToolUse")
    if echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "git commit\\|git push"; then
        # Trigger CI/CD debug monitoring
        echo "[$TIMESTAMP] CI_WATCH: Commit made, monitoring for integration issues" >> "$LOG_FILE"
        
        # Set up CI failure monitoring
        (
            sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes for CI
            if curl -s "$CI_STATUS_URL" | grep -q "failed"; then
                echo "[$TIMESTAMP] CI_FAILURE: Automatic debug context capture initiated" >> "$LOG_FILE"
                # Trigger automatic debug analysis
                @engineer.md "$CURRENT_SPEC" debug "CI failure detected after recent commit"
            fi
        ) &
    fi
    ;;
```

### Pre-commit Debug Validation

```bash
# Pre-commit debug check
git_commit_hook() {
    # Check for potential debug issues before commit
    RECENT_ERRORS=$(tail -100 "$HOOK_LOG" | grep "ERROR\\|WARN" | wc -l)
    
    if [ "$RECENT_ERRORS" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "⚠️  Recent errors detected in session. Consider debugging before commit:"
        tail -100 "$HOOK_LOG" | grep "ERROR\\|WARN" | tail -3
        
        read -p "Continue with commit? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
        echo
        if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
}
```

## Part 8: Advanced Debug Automation

### Automated Issue Classification

```bash
# AI-powered issue classification
"PostToolUse")
    if echo "$INPUT" | grep -q "error\\|Error\\|ERROR\\|failed\\|Failed"; then
        ERROR_CONTEXT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_response.stderr // .tool_response.error // .tool_response.content')
        
        # Use Claude CLI for intelligent classification
        ISSUE_TYPE=$(echo "$ERROR_CONTEXT" | claude -p "Classify this error type in one word (syntax/logic/integration/performance/security): " 2>/dev/null)
        
        echo "[$TIMESTAMP] AUTO_CLASSIFY: $ISSUE_TYPE - $ERROR_CONTEXT" >> "$CLASSIFICATION_LOG"
        
        # Auto-suggest debug approach based on classification
        case "$ISSUE_TYPE" in
            "syntax")
                say -v Samantha -r 175 "Syntax error. Check recent edits." &
                ;;
            "logic")
                say -v Samantha -r 175 "Logic error. Consider step-by-step debugging." &
                ;;
            "integration")
                say -v Samantha -r 175 "Integration issue. Check external dependencies." &
                ;;
        esac
    fi
    ;;
```

### Smart Debug Suggestions

```bash
# Context-aware debug suggestions
suggest_debug_approach() {
    local ERROR_TYPE="$1"
    local FILE_PATH="$2"
    local SESSION_CONTEXT="$3"
    
    # Analyze context for smart suggestions
    if echo "$SESSION_CONTEXT" | grep -q "database\\|migration\\|schema"; then
        echo "💡 Database-related error detected. Suggested debug approach:"
        echo "   1. Check migration status"
        echo "   2. Verify schema changes"
        echo "   3. Test database connectivity"
        echo "   Use: @engineer.md debug 'database connection issue after schema changes'"
    elif echo "$SESSION_CONTEXT" | grep -q "api\\|endpoint\\|request"; then
        echo "💡 API-related error detected. Suggested debug approach:"
        echo "   1. Check API endpoint configuration"
        echo "   2. Verify request/response formats"  
        echo "   3. Test authentication"
        echo "   Use: @engineer.md debug 'API endpoint returning unexpected response'"
    fi
}
```
