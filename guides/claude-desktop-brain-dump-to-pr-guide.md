      "MAX_FILE_SIZE": "10MB"
    }
  }
}
```

### Project Rules Configuration

Project rules provide Claude Desktop with the systematic workflow for your specific codebase.

#### Basic Project Rules Setup

1. **Create Project Rules File**
   
   In your repository root, create `.claude/project-rules.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Project Rules for [Your Project Name]
   
   **Note**: This requires Claude Desktop and Desktop Commander MCP for end-to-end brain-dump → development workflow
   
   # Code Context
   
   - The code is available in: /path/to/your/project
   - Use Desktop Commander MCP to read the files
   - Main application files are in: [specify main directories]
   - Project technology stack: [list main technologies]
   
   # Workflow Stages
   [Include the four-stage workflow detailed below]
   ```

2. **Customize for Your Tech Stack**
   
   Update the project rules with your specific:
   - **Technology Stack**: Frontend/backend frameworks, databases
   - **Architecture Patterns**: MVC, microservices, monolith structure
   - **Coding Standards**: Naming conventions, file organization
   - **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests, coverage requirements
   - **Deployment Process**: Build steps, CI/CD pipeline requirements

#### Technology-Specific Examples

**React + Node.js Project:**
```markdown
# Code Context
- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript in `/src/frontend`
- Backend: Node.js with Express in `/src/backend`
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Testing: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E
- State Management: Redux Toolkit
```

**Python Django Project:**
```markdown
# Code Context
- Backend: Django 4.x in `/myproject`
- Frontend: Django templates with Alpine.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Testing: pytest and Django TestCase
- API: Django REST Framework
```

### Codebase Connection Setup

#### Initial Codebase Analysis

1. **Start Exploration Session**
   ```
   I want to understand the architecture of my project at /path/to/your/project. 
   Please explore the codebase and provide a comprehensive analysis of:
   - Main application structure
   - Technology stack and dependencies
   - Key architectural patterns
   - Database schema and models
   - API endpoints and routes
   - Frontend components and state management
   ```

2. **Document Key Findings**
   
   Save the architectural analysis as an artifact in Claude Desktop. This becomes your reference for all future feature development.

3. **Test Integration Points**
   ```
   Based on your analysis, walk me through how I would add a new feature that:
   - Adds a database table
   - Creates API endpoints
   - Updates the frontend
   This will help me understand the integration patterns.
   ```

### Validation Steps

Before proceeding with development workflow:

- [ ] **MCP Connection**: Desktop Commander can read and analyze your codebase
- [ ] **Project Rules**: Configured for your specific technology stack
- [ ] **Architecture Understanding**: Claude Desktop can explain your codebase structure
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Can describe how to add features following existing patterns
- [ ] **Artifact Creation**: Can save PRDs and task lists as artifacts for reference

## The Four-Stage Workflow

The Claude Desktop workflow consists of four systematic stages that transform brain-dump ideas into production-ready pull requests.

### Stage 1: PRD Generation

**Goal**: Transform unclear feature requests into crystal-clear Product Requirements Documents with 95%+ confidence.

#### Process Overview

1. **Brain-Dump Input**: Provide your feature idea in natural language
2. **Codebase Exploration**: Claude Desktop uses MCP to understand existing architecture
3. **Requirement Crystallization**: Interactive clarification to achieve 95% confidence
4. **PRD Creation**: Generate comprehensive specification document

#### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Initial Brain-Dump**

Start your conversation with:
```
I want to add [feature description] to my application. 
This should [describe the desired functionality and user experience].
Please create a comprehensive PRD for this feature.
```

**Example:**
```
I want to add a user authentication system to my e-commerce app. 
This should include email/password login, social media login with Google and GitHub, 
password reset functionality, and user profile management. 
The system should integrate with our existing cart and order history.
```

**Step 2: Codebase Analysis (Automated)**

Claude Desktop will automatically:
- Explore your codebase using Desktop Commander MCP
- Analyze existing authentication patterns (if any)
- Understand database schema and models
- Review API structure and routing patterns
- Identify frontend architecture and state management

**Step 3: Requirement Clarification**

Claude Desktop will ask targeted questions (maximum 5 per iteration):

```
Based on my analysis of your codebase, I need clarification on:

1. User Data Storage: Should user profiles integrate with your existing Users table, or create a separate authentication system?

2. Social Login Integration: Your app uses OAuth for payment processing. Should we use the same OAuth library or implement separate social login?

3. Session Management: I see you're using JWT tokens for API authentication. Should the new user auth extend this pattern or implement separate session management?

4. Frontend Integration: Your checkout flow uses Redux for state management. Should user authentication state follow the same pattern?

5. Database Migrations: I notice you're using Prisma migrations. Should the new user tables follow your existing migration naming conventions?
```

**Step 4: PRD Generation**

Once 95% confidence is achieved, Claude Desktop generates a comprehensive PRD including:

- **Executive Summary**: Feature overview and impact
- **Product Specifications**: User stories, functional requirements, non-goals
- **Technical Specifications**: Architecture, database design, API specifications
- **Implementation Specifications**: Coding standards, testing requirements

**Step 5: Artifact Saving**

Save the PRD as an artifact in Claude Desktop:
```
Save this PRD as an artifact with context "PRD-user-authentication-system"
```

This creates a referenceable document for the next stages.

#### PRD Quality Validation

A high-quality PRD should include:

- [ ] **Clear User Stories**: Specific scenarios with acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Technical Integration**: How feature fits with existing codebase
- [ ] **Database Design**: Specific table structures and relationships  
- [ ] **API Specifications**: Endpoint definitions with request/response formats
- [ ] **Frontend Requirements**: Component structure and user flows
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E test requirements
- [ ] **95% Confidence**: All ambiguity resolved before proceeding

### Stage 2: Task Decomposition

**Goal**: Break down the PRD into implementable tasks with clear dependencies and execution order.

#### Process Overview

1. **Architecture Analysis**: Map PRD requirements to technical components
2. **Task Generation**: Create specific, actionable tasks
3. **Dependency Ordering**: Organize tasks by implementation layers
4. **JSON Artifact**: Generate structured task list for execution

#### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Load PRD Context**

Begin task decomposition:
```
Using the PRD artifact "PRD-user-authentication-system", 
please break this down into implementable tasks following the task decomposition protocol.
```

**Step 2: Architecture Analysis**

Claude Desktop will analyze:
- **Core Functional Requirements**: What needs to be built
- **Technical Components**: Database, backend, frontend, integration pieces
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed before other tasks can start
- **Implementation Layers**: Logical grouping of related tasks

**Step 3: Task Generation**

Tasks are generated following this JSON schema:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "prd_source": "PRD-user-authentication-system",
    "project_type": "existing",
    "total_tasks": 15,
    "estimated_hours": 24
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "DB-001",
      "title": "Create user authentication database schema",
      "description": "Design and implement database tables for user accounts, supporting email/password and social login with proper indexing and constraints",
      "category": "database",
      "status": "todo",
      "dependencies": [],
      "files_affected": [
        "prisma/schema.prisma",
        "prisma/migrations/"
      ],
      "implementation_details": {
        "approach": "Extend existing Prisma schema with User, UserSession, and SocialAccount models",
        "key_functions": ["User.findByEmail", "UserSession.create", "SocialAccount.linkToUser"],
        "libraries_used": ["prisma@5.x", "bcryptjs@2.x"],
        "database_changes": [
          "Add users table with email, password_hash, profile fields",
          "Add user_sessions table for session management",
          "Add social_accounts table for OAuth linking"
        ]
      },
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Database schema allows email/password and social login",
        "All tables have proper indexes for performance",
        "Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity",
        "Migration runs successfully without errors"
      ],
      "potential_blockers": [
        "Existing User model conflicts",
        "Database migration rollback requirements"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Dependency Ordering**

Tasks are organized by implementation layers:

**For Existing Codebases:**
- **Database (DB-XXX)**: Schema migrations and updates
- **Backend (BE-XXX)**: Service modifications and new endpoints  
- **API (API-XXX)**: REST/GraphQL endpoint implementation
- **Frontend (FE-XXX)**: Component updates and new features
- **Integration (INT-XXX)**: End-to-end flow testing
- **Testing (TEST-XXX)**: Regression and migration validation

**Step 5: Task Artifact Creation**

Save the task breakdown:
```
Save this task breakdown as an artifact with context "tasks-user-authentication.json"
```

#### Task Quality Validation

High-quality tasks should have:

- [ ] **Specific Titles**: Clear, actionable task descriptions
- [ ] **Detailed Implementation**: Approach, functions, libraries specified
- [ ] **File-Level Precision**: Exact files that will be modified
- [ ] **Testable Acceptance Criteria**: Objective success measures
- [ ] **Risk Awareness**: Potential blockers identified
- [ ] **Proper Dependencies**: Logical ordering prevents conflicts

### Stage 3: Implementation Execution

**Goal**: Systematically implement tasks using a two-phase protocol with comprehensive progress tracking.

#### Two-Phase Protocol

The implementation follows a rigorous two-phase approach:

1. **Planning Phase**: Build confidence and gather context
2. **Execution Phase**: Implement with systematic progress tracking

#### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Load Task Context**

Begin implementation:
```
Load the task artifact "tasks-user-authentication.json" and begin implementation 
following the two-phase protocol. Start with the first layer (Database).
```

**Step 2: Planning Phase for Each Task**

For each task, Claude Desktop will:

```
Phase: PLANNING
Task: DB-001 - Create user authentication database schema
Confidence: Analyzing...

Context Gathering:
- Reading existing Prisma schema
- Understanding current User model (if exists)
- Reviewing migration patterns
- Checking database constraints and indexes
- Analyzing integration points with existing code

<thinking>
Current state: 
- Existing database has Products, Orders, Cart tables
- No current User authentication (guest checkout only)
- Using Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Migration naming follows timestamp-description pattern

Dependencies: 
- No prerequisites for this task (first in layer)

Implementation approach:
1. Create User model in schema.prisma with email, password fields
2. Add UserSession model for session management  
3. Add SocialAccount model for OAuth connections
4. Create migration with proper indexes and constraints
5. Verify migration runs successfully

Risks and solutions:
- Risk: Existing guest data needs user association
- Solution: Add nullable user_id to existing tables as future enhancement
</thinking>

Confidence: 95% - Ready to proceed with implementation
```

**Step 3: Execution Phase**

Once planning phase reaches 95% confidence:

```
Phase: EXECUTION
Task: DB-001 - Create user authentication database schema

Current State:
- Existing: Product catalog and cart system without user accounts
- Dependencies: None (first task in database layer)
- Integration: Will extend existing Prisma setup

Technical Details:
- Patterns: Following existing Prisma model conventions
- Libraries: Extending current prisma@5.x setup
- Database: PostgreSQL with existing connection
- Testing: Will verify with Prisma Studio and test queries

Implementation:
[Systematic code implementation with specific file changes]
```

**Step 4: Layer-by-Layer Execution**

Implementation proceeds through logical layers:

1. **Database Layer (DB-XXX)**
   - All database schema and migration tasks
   - Validation: Migrations run successfully, data models accessible

2. **Backend Layer (BE-XXX)**  
   - Business logic and service implementation
   - Validation: Services work with new database schema

3. **API Layer (API-XXX)**
   - REST/GraphQL endpoint implementation
   - Validation: Endpoints return expected responses

4. **Frontend Layer (FE-XXX)**
   - User interface and component implementation
   - Validation: UI integrates with API endpoints

5. **Integration Layer (INT-XXX)**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Validation: Complete user journeys work as expected

**Step 5: Progress Documentation**

After completing each layer, Claude Desktop will document progress:

```markdown
### Layer Completed: Database Layer
- **Status**: Completed
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-15 14:30:00
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - `DB-001`: Create user authentication database schema
  - `DB-002`: Create user session management tables
  - `DB-003`: Add indexes for authentication performance
- **Summary**: Database schema created with proper user authentication tables, 
  session management, and social login support. All migrations tested successfully.
```

#### Implementation Quality Gates

Each layer must pass validation before proceeding:

- [ ] **Code Compiles**: No syntax or type errors
- [ ] **Tests Pass**: All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] **Integration Works**: New code integrates with existing patterns
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: Code changes include appropriate comments
- [ ] **Migration Tested**: Database changes apply cleanly

### Stage 4: Debug & Resolution

**Goal**: Systematically identify and resolve issues using structured analysis and root cause identification.

#### Debug Protocol

When issues arise during implementation, follow this structured approach:

**Step 1: Error Documentation**
```
I'm encountering an error during task BE-003 (Create authentication middleware).
Error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined in authMiddleware.js:15"

Please analyze this error using the debug protocol.
```

**Step 2: Context Analysis**

Claude Desktop will:
- **Load Full Context**: Review the task, PRD, and implementation history
- **Examine Recent Changes**: Analyze all files modified in the current layer
- **Review Error Location**: Understand the specific code causing the issue
- **Check Dependencies**: Verify all prerequisites are properly implemented

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**

```
<thinking>
Error Analysis:
- Error occurs in authMiddleware.js line 15
- Trying to access 'user' property on undefined object
- This suggests request.session or similar object is undefined

Recent Changes Analysis:
- BE-002 created session management service
- BE-003 implementing middleware to use sessions
- Session middleware might not be properly configured

Potential Root Causes:
1. Session middleware not added to Express app before auth middleware
2. Session service not properly initializing session object
3. Middleware order issue in Express routing
4. Missing session configuration in environment

File Analysis Required:
- authMiddleware.js (error location)
- sessionService.js (dependency)
- app.js or server.js (middleware configuration)
- .env or config files (session settings)
</thinking>

Root Cause Identified: Session middleware not configured before authentication middleware
```

**Step 4: Propose Solution**

```
Root Cause: The Express session middleware is not configured before the authentication 
middleware, causing req.session to be undefined.

Proposed Fix:
1. Add express-session middleware configuration in app.js before routes
2. Ensure session middleware loads before authentication middleware
3. Add proper session store configuration for production
4. Update middleware order in route configuration

Files to modify:
- src/app.js: Add session middleware configuration
- src/middleware/authMiddleware.js: Add defensive check for session existence
- package.json: Add express-session dependency if missing

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this fix?
```

**Step 5: Implement Resolution**

After approval, implement the fix and document the resolution:

```markdown
### Debug Session: 2025-01-15 16:45:00
- **Issue**: Task `BE-003` failed with error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined"
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Express session middleware not configured before authentication middleware, causing req.session to be undefined
- **Resolution**: 
  1. Added express-session middleware configuration in app.js
  2. Reordered middleware to ensure session loads before authentication  
  3. Added defensive programming checks in authMiddleware.js
  4. Updated environment configuration for session store
- **Status**: Resolved - Task BE-003 now completing successfully
```

#### Prevention Measures

After resolving issues, implement prevention measures:

- **Code Review**: Add checks to prevent similar issues
- **Documentation**: Update implementation guides with lessons learned
- **Testing**: Add specific tests for the resolved issue
- **Patterns**: Update project rules to include new best practices

## Real-World Examples

This section provides complete walkthroughs of the four-stage workflow applied to realistic development scenarios.

### Example 1: New Feature Development - User Notification System

**Scenario**: Adding a comprehensive notification system to an existing e-commerce application.

#### Stage 1: PRD Generation

**Initial Brain-Dump:**
```
I want to add a notification system to my e-commerce app. Users should receive 
notifications for order updates, promotional offers, and system announcements. 
The system should support in-app notifications, email, and push notifications. 
Users should be able to customize their notification preferences.
```

**Codebase Exploration Results:**
- Existing tech stack: React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database
- Current user management system in place
- Email service using SendGrid for order confirmations
- No existing notification infrastructure

**Clarification Questions:**
1. **Real-time Delivery**: Should in-app notifications be real-time using WebSockets, or is polling acceptable?
2. **Push Notification Platform**: Do you want to support both iOS and Android push notifications, or web push only?
3. **Email Templates**: Should we extend your existing SendGrid integration or implement a separate email system?
4. **Notification History**: How long should notifications be stored? Should users be able to view notification history?
5. **Administrative Interface**: Do you need an admin panel for sending system-wide notifications?

**Generated PRD (Key Sections):**

```markdown
## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: In-app notification system
  - Given: User is active in the application
  - When: Notification is triggered by system event
  - Then: User sees real-time notification in UI with appropriate icon and message
  - Acceptance: WebSocket connection maintains real-time delivery with <2 second latency

- **FR-002**: Email notification delivery
  - Given: User has email notifications enabled for specific event type
  - When: Triggering event occurs (order update, promotion, etc.)
  - Then: Formatted email is delivered using existing SendGrid integration
  - Acceptance: Email delivery confirmed within 30 seconds of event

- **FR-003**: User preference management
  - Given: User wants to customize notification settings
  - When: User accesses notification preferences in account settings
  - Then: User can enable/disable notifications by type and delivery method
  - Acceptance: Preference changes take effect immediately for new notifications
```

#### Stage 2: Task Decomposition

**Generated Task Structure:**

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "prd_source": "PRD-notification-system",
    "project_type": "existing",
    "total_tasks": 18,
    "estimated_hours": 32
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "DB-001",
      "title": "Create notification system database schema",
      "description": "Design and implement tables for notifications, user preferences, and notification templates with proper indexing for performance",
      "category": "database",
      "dependencies": [],
      "implementation_details": {
        "approach": "Add Notification, UserNotificationPreference, and NotificationTemplate models to existing Prisma schema",
        "database_changes": [
          "notifications table with type, recipient, content, delivery status",
          "user_notification_preferences table for customization",
          "notification_templates table for reusable message formats"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "BE-001", 
      "title": "Implement notification service layer",
      "description": "Create core notification business logic including creation, delivery routing, and preference checking",
      "category": "backend",
      "dependencies": ["DB-001"],
      "implementation_details": {
        "key_functions": ["NotificationService.create", "NotificationService.deliver", "PreferenceService.checkUserSettings"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Stage 3: Implementation Execution

**Database Layer Implementation:**

```
Phase: PLANNING
Task: DB-001 - Create notification system database schema
Confidence: 95%

Context Analysis:
- Existing User model can be extended with notification preferences
- Current email system using SendGrid can be leveraged
- Need to design for scalability with notification volume

Phase: EXECUTION
[Implements Prisma schema updates, creates migrations, tests database connectivity]

Database Layer Completed Successfully ✓
```

**Backend Layer Implementation:**

```
Phase: PLANNING  
Task: BE-001 - Implement notification service layer
Confidence: 95%

Dependencies Verified:
- Database schema available from DB-001
- User model accessible for preference lookups

```

#### Stage 4: Debug Example

**Issue Encountered:**
```
During INT-002 (WebSocket integration testing), getting error:
"WebSocket connection failed with 403 Forbidden"
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
Analysis:
- WebSocket server requires authentication
- Frontend attempting connection before user authentication complete
- Missing authentication token in WebSocket handshake

Resolution:
1. Modified WebSocket connection to wait for user authentication
2. Added JWT token to WebSocket handshake headers
3. Updated server-side WebSocket authentication middleware
4. Added connection retry logic for authentication failures

Status: Resolved ✓
```

### Example 2: Existing Codebase Enhancement - Performance Optimization

**Scenario**: Optimizing an existing React application with performance issues.

#### Stage 1: PRD Generation

**Initial Brain-Dump:**
```
My React app is having performance issues. The main dashboard loads slowly, 
especially with large datasets. Users are complaining about lag when filtering 
and sorting data. I want to implement performance optimizations including 
data virtualization, better caching, and lazy loading.
```

**Codebase Analysis Results:**
- React 18 with Redux Toolkit for state management
- Large data tables rendering 1000+ rows without virtualization
- API calls not cached, causing repeated requests
- No code splitting or lazy loading implemented
- Bundle size analysis shows opportunities for optimization

**Generated PRD includes:**
- Specific performance metrics and targets
- Component-level optimization strategies  
- Bundle size reduction goals
- Caching implementation requirements

#### Implementation Highlights

**Task Examples:**
- **FE-001**: Implement React.memo and useMemo optimizations
- **FE-002**: Add react-window for data virtualization
- **FE-003**: Implement React.lazy for code splitting
- **BE-004**: Add Redis caching layer for API responses
- **INT-001**: Performance testing and validation

### Example 3: Bug Fix and Improvement Workflow

**Scenario**: Systematic approach to fixing a complex authentication bug while adding security improvements.

#### Bug Analysis Process

**Issue Description:**
```
Users are getting randomly logged out, and some users report being able to 
access other users' data briefly before being redirected. This seems like 
a serious security issue that needs immediate attention while also improving 
our overall authentication security.
```

**Four-Stage Applied to Bug Fix:**

1. **PRD Generation**: Analysis reveals session management issues and opportunity for security enhancement
2. **Task Decomposition**: Break down into immediate fixes and long-term security improvements
3. **Implementation**: Systematic fixing with security-first approach
4. **Debug Protocol**: Root cause analysis reveals session race conditions

**Key Learning**: The workflow's systematic approach prevented quick patches and ensured comprehensive security review.

## Team Collaboration

The Claude Desktop workflow scales from individual developers to teams through shared artifacts, standardized processes, and collaborative patterns.

### Project Rules Customization for Teams

#### Team-Specific Configuration

**Step 1: Establish Team Standards**

Create team-specific project rules that include:

```markdown
# Team Project Rules for [Team Name]

## Code Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **File Organization**: Features grouped by domain, shared utilities in /common
- **Comment Requirements**: JSDoc for all public functions, inline comments for complex logic
- **Testing Standards**: 80% coverage minimum, integration tests for all API endpoints

## Architecture Patterns
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for API calls
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design principles (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **API Design**: RESTful with consistent error handling and response formats
- **Database**: Prisma with explicit migrations, no auto-migrations in production

## Review Requirements
- **Code Review**: All PRs require 2 approvals from team members
- **PRD Review**: Product requirements need product owner sign-off before implementation
- **Architecture Review**: Major changes require tech lead approval
- **Security Review**: Authentication/authorization changes need security team review
```

**Step 2: Workflow Customization**

Adapt the four-stage workflow for team processes:

```markdown
# Team Workflow Extensions

## Stage 1: PRD Generation (Extended)
- **Stakeholder Input**: Include product owner and design team in requirement gathering
- **Business Impact**: Add business metrics and success criteria for each feature
- **Timeline Considerations**: Include sprint planning and release cycle impact
- **Resource Allocation**: Estimate team member assignments and skill requirements

## Stage 2: Task Decomposition (Extended)  
- **Assignment Strategy**: Tag tasks with required skills (frontend, backend, DevOps)
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Identify tasks that can be worked on simultaneously
- **Review Points**: Build in checkpoints for team sync and progress review
- **Risk Mitigation**: Include fallback plans for complex or uncertain tasks

## Stage 3: Implementation (Extended)
- **Pair Programming**: Identify tasks that benefit from collaborative implementation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Schedule team reviews for complex implementations
- **Integration Testing**: Coordinate testing across different team members' work
- **Documentation**: Include team knowledge transfer in implementation process

## Stage 4: Debug (Extended)
- **Team Debug Sessions**: Process for escalating complex issues to team debugging
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document solutions in shared team knowledge base
- **Process Improvement**: Regular retrospectives on workflow effectiveness
```

#### Multi-Developer Workflow Patterns

**Pattern 1: Feature Team Collaboration**

```
Team Structure: 1 Product Owner + 1 Tech Lead + 2-3 Developers

Workflow Distribution:
- Product Owner: Participates in Stage 1 (PRD review and approval)
- Tech Lead: Leads Stage 2 (architecture decisions and task review)
- Developers: Execute Stage 3 (implementation) with peer review
- Team: Collaborative Stage 4 (debugging and knowledge sharing)

Artifact Sharing:
- PRDs shared in team Slack/Teams channel
- Task artifacts uploaded to shared drive with version control
- Implementation progress tracked in team dashboard
- Debug logs added to team knowledge base
```

**Pattern 2: Cross-Functional Integration**

```
Extended Team: Dev Team + Design + DevOps + QA

Stage 1 Collaboration:
- Designer reviews user experience requirements in PRD
- DevOps reviews infrastructure and deployment considerations
- QA reviews testing requirements and acceptance criteria

Stage 2 Collaboration:
- Design provides UI/UX mockups for frontend tasks
- DevOps adds deployment and monitoring tasks
- QA adds comprehensive testing task breakdown

Stage 3 Collaboration:
- Developers implement with design review checkpoints
- DevOps prepares infrastructure in parallel
- QA develops test cases based on task acceptance criteria

Stage 4 Collaboration:
- Cross-functional debug sessions for integration issues
- Shared post-mortem process for significant issues
```

### Artifact Sharing and Review Processes

#### PRD Collaboration Process

**Step 1: PRD Creation and Initial Review**

```
1. Developer creates initial PRD using Claude Desktop workflow
2. Save PRD artifact and share link with team
3. Schedule 30-minute PRD review meeting with stakeholders
4. Collect feedback and questions in shared document
5. Update PRD based on team input using Claude Desktop
6. Final approval from product owner and tech lead
```

```

### Knowledge Transfer Patterns

#### Team Learning from Workflow Artifacts

**Weekly Artifact Review:**
```
Every Friday: 30-minute team session reviewing completed artifacts from the week

Agenda:
1. PRD Review: What user problems did we solve this week?
2. Task Analysis: Which tasks took longer than expected and why?
3. Implementation Patterns: What new patterns or techniques did we discover?
4. Debug Learning: What issues did we encounter and how did we solve them?
5. Process Improvement: How can we improve the workflow for next week?
```

## Troubleshooting & Advanced Patterns

This section addresses common issues and advanced use cases for the Claude Desktop workflow.

### Common Workflow Issues

#### Issue 1: MCP Connection Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Claude Desktop cannot access codebase
- "File not found" errors during codebase exploration
- Permissions denied when trying to read project files

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Verify MCP Configuration:**
   ```
   Check Claude Desktop settings → MCP Servers → Desktop Commander status
   Should show: "Connected" with green indicator
   ```

2. **Test Basic MCP Functionality:**
   ```
   In Claude Desktop: "Can you list the files in my home directory?"
   Expected: Should return file listing without errors
   ```

3. **Check Path Configuration:**
   ```json
   // In mcp_servers.json, verify WORKSPACE_PATH
   {
     "desktop-commander": {
       "env": {
         "WORKSPACE_PATH": "/correct/path/to/your/projects"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Solutions:**

**Solution A: MCP Restart**
```bash
# Kill existing MCP processes
pkill -f desktop-commander

# Restart Claude Desktop
# MCP will auto-reconnect on next conversation
```

**Solution B: Path Correction**
```json
// Update mcp_servers.json with correct paths
{
  "desktop-commander": {
    "command": "desktop-commander",
    "args": ["--port", "3001"],
    "env": {
      "WORKSPACE_PATH": "/Users/yourusername/Projects",
      "ALLOWED_PATHS": "/Users/yourusername/Projects/project1,/Users/yourusername/Projects/project2"
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution C: Permissions Fix**
```bash
# Give Claude Desktop full disk access in macOS
System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access → Add Claude Desktop
```

#### Issue 2: Low PRD Confidence Scores

**Symptoms:**
- PRD generation gets stuck at <90% confidence
- Repeated questions without progress toward clarity
- Vague or contradictory requirements in generated PRDs

**Root Causes and Solutions:**

**Cause A: Insufficient Codebase Understanding**
```
Problem: Claude Desktop hasn't fully grasped existing architecture

Solution: Explicit codebase exploration
"Before creating the PRD, please spend time exploring my codebase structure. 
Specifically analyze:
- Main application architecture and patterns
- Database schema and relationships  
- API endpoint organization
- Frontend component structure
- Authentication and authorization patterns

Provide a comprehensive summary before proceeding with PRD generation."
```

**Cause B: Ambiguous Feature Requirements**
```
Problem: Initial brain-dump lacks specific details

Solution: Structured requirement input
"Let me provide more specific requirements:

Business Context:
- Target users: [specific user types]
- User pain points: [specific problems being solved]
- Success metrics: [measurable outcomes]

Technical Context:  
- Integration points: [specific existing features to integrate with]
- Performance requirements: [specific metrics]
- Scale requirements: [expected usage volume]

Constraints:
- Timeline: [deadline requirements]
- Resource limitations: [team size, technology constraints]
- Must-not-break: [existing functionality that must remain unchanged]"
```

**Cause C: Complex Multi-Feature Requests**
```
Problem: Feature request is too broad for single PRD

Solution: Feature decomposition
"This seems like a complex feature that should be broken down. 
Please help me decompose this into 2-3 separate, focused features that can be 
implemented independently. For each sub-feature, create a separate PRD."
```

#### Issue 3: Task Dependency Deadlocks

**Symptoms:**
- Circular dependencies in task breakdown
- Tasks that cannot be started due to missing prerequisites
- Implementation gets stuck waiting for dependencies

**Prevention:**
```json
// Good dependency structure
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "DB-001", "dependencies": []},
    {"id": "DB-002", "dependencies": ["DB-001"]},
    {"id": "BE-001", "dependencies": ["DB-001", "DB-002"]},
    {"id": "FE-001", "dependencies": ["BE-001"]}
  ]
}

// Problematic dependency structure  
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "BE-001", "dependencies": ["FE-001"]},
    {"id": "FE-001", "dependencies": ["BE-001"]}  // Circular!
  ]
}
```

**Resolution Process:**
```
"I notice circular dependencies in the task breakdown. Please re-analyze and:
1. Identify the core dependency cycle
2. Determine which components can be implemented with stub/mock versions
3. Reorder tasks to break the cycle
4. Create interface/contract tasks that allow parallel development"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Codebase Handling

**Issue:** Workflow becomes slow with codebases >100k lines

**Optimization Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Focused Exploration**
```
Instead of: "Analyze my entire codebase"

Use: "Focus your analysis on these specific areas:
- Authentication module in /src/auth/
- User management in /src/users/  
- Database models in /src/models/
- API routes in /src/routes/users.js

Skip: /src/legacy/, /tests/, /docs/, /node_modules/"
```

**Strategy 2: Incremental Context Building**
```
"Let's build context incrementally:

Phase 1: High-level architecture overview
Phase 2: Focus on [specific module] where the new feature will integrate
Phase 3: Analyze patterns in similar existing features
Phase 4: Generate PRD based on this focused understanding"
```

**Strategy 3: Component-Specific Analysis**
```
// For large React applications
"Analyze only the component tree related to user management:
- /src/components/User/
- /src/hooks/useAuth.js
- /src/store/userSlice.js
- /src/pages/UserProfile/

Ignore other feature areas for this PRD."
```

#### Workflow Acceleration Techniques

**Technique 1: Template Reuse**
```markdown
# Create reusable PRD templates for common feature types

## Template: Authentication Feature
- Standard user stories for login/logout/registration
- Common technical requirements (JWT, password hashing, session management)
- Typical database schema patterns
- Standard API endpoint patterns

## Template: CRUD Feature  
- Standard user stories for create/read/update/delete operations
- Common database patterns (models, relationships, constraints)
- Typical API endpoint patterns (REST conventions)
- Standard frontend component patterns

Usage: "Create a PRD for user profile management using the CRUD feature template"
```

**Technique 2: Rapid Prototyping Mode**
```
"I need a rapid prototype PRD for user feedback. Please:
1. Focus on core user stories only (skip edge cases)
2. Use standard technology patterns from my codebase
3. Target 80% confidence instead of 95% for faster iteration
4. Generate minimal but implementable task breakdown

We'll refine after user feedback."
```

### Advanced Use Cases

#### Multi-Repository Features

**Scenario:** Feature spans multiple repositories (microservices, frontend/backend separation)

**Workflow Adaptation:**

```markdown
# Multi-Repo Feature: Cross-Service User Analytics

## Repository Context
- **Frontend Repo**: React dashboard at /path/to/frontend-repo
- **User Service**: Node.js service at /path/to/user-service  
- **Analytics Service**: Python service at /path/to/analytics-service
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript definitions at /path/to/shared-types

## Modified Workflow

### Stage 1: Multi-Repo PRD Generation
"Create a PRD for user analytics feature that spans:
1. Frontend dashboard components (React repo)
2. User data collection (User service)  
3. Analytics processing (Analytics service)
4. Shared type definitions

For each repo, analyze existing patterns and create integration requirements."

### Stage 2: Cross-Service Task Decomposition
Tasks include cross-repo dependencies:
- TYPES-001: Update shared type definitions
- USER-001: Add analytics data collection (depends on TYPES-001)
- ANALYTICS-001: Implement processing service (depends on TYPES-001)  
- FRONTEND-001: Create dashboard (depends on USER-001, ANALYTICS-001)

### Stage 3: Coordinated Implementation
- Implement in dependency order across repositories
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Coordinate testing across service boundaries
```

#### Legacy System Integration

**Scenario:** Adding modern features to legacy codebase

**Special Considerations:**

```markdown
# Legacy Integration Protocol

## Pre-Workflow Analysis
"Before creating PRD, analyze legacy constraints:
1. What legacy systems must we integrate with?
2. What are the data format and API constraints?
3. What existing business logic must be preserved?
4. What modern patterns can be safely introduced?"

## Adapted PRD Requirements
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Explicit requirements for backward compatibility
- **Migration Strategy**: Step-by-step approach for modernization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Fallback plans for integration failures
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive regression testing requirements

## Modified Implementation  
- **Incremental Approach**: Small, safe changes with validation
- **Adapter Patterns**: Clean interfaces between legacy and modern code
- **Feature Flags**: Safe rollout with quick rollback capability
```

#### API-First Development

**Scenario:** Building features API-first for multiple consumers

**Workflow Modifications:**

```markdown
# API-First Feature Development

## Stage 1: API-Centric PRD
"Create a PRD focusing on API design first:
1. Define data models and relationships
2. Specify API endpoints with request/response schemas
3. Define authentication and authorization requirements
4. Include API documentation and testing requirements
5. Plan for multiple consumers (web, mobile, third-party)"

## Stage 2: API-First Task Breakdown  
Layer ordering modified:
1. **SCHEMA-XXX**: Data models and database schema
2. **API-XXX**: API endpoint implementation with full documentation
3. **TEST-XXX**: API testing and validation
4. **CONSUMER-XXX**: Frontend/mobile implementation
5. **INTEGRATION-XXX**: End-to-end testing

## Stage 3: Contract-First Implementation
- Implement API contracts before implementation
- Use API mocking for parallel frontend development
- Validate with consumer teams before final implementation
```

### Custom Workflow Adaptations

#### Team-Specific Adaptations

**Startup Environment:**
```markdown
# Startup-Optimized Workflow

Modifications:
- **Rapid Iteration**: Target 85% confidence for faster market validation
- **MVP Focus**: Explicitly identify must-have vs nice-to-have features
- **Resource Constraints**: Include implementation alternatives for small teams
- **Technical Debt**: Plan for "quick implementation now, refactor later" approach

Additional Stages:
- **Stage 0**: Market validation and user research
- **Stage 5**: Post-launch metrics and iteration planning
```

**Enterprise Environment:**
```markdown
# Enterprise-Optimized Workflow

Additional Requirements:
- **Compliance**: Include security, audit, and regulatory requirements
- **Architecture Review**: Formal architecture committee approval process
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation requirements
- **Change Management**: Impact analysis on existing systems and processes

Extended Stages:
- **Stage 1.5**: Security and compliance review
- **Stage 2.5**: Architecture committee approval
- **Stage 3.5**: Formal testing and validation procedures
- **Stage 4.5**: Deployment and rollback planning
```
