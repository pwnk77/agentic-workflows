# Getting Started with Agentic Workflows

## 5-Minute Quick Start

Transform your first development task using AI automation in just 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Choose Your Path (1 minute)

Pick the workflow that matches your current setup:

- **Have Claude Code?** → [Claude Code Complete Workflow](claude-code-command-guide.md)
- **Have Claude Desktop?** → [Brain-Dump to PR Guide](claude-desktop-brain-dump-to-pr-guide.md)  
- **Have Cursor IDE?** → [Development Lifecycle Guide](cursor-rules-beginner-development-lifecycle.md)
- **Not sure?** → Continue with this quick start

### Step 2: Simple Brain-Dump Test (2 minutes)

Try this basic automation pattern:

1. **Describe** a small feature or fix in plain English
2. **Ask AI** to break it down into steps
3. **Follow** the AI-generated implementation plan
4. **Observe** how much faster you complete the task

**Example Brain-Dump**:
> "Add a simple user preferences page where users can update their email and notification settings"

### Step 3: Pick Your Tools (1 minute)

Based on your experience, choose your primary automation tool:

| Tool | Best For | Setup Time |
|------|----------|------------|
| Claude Code | Systematic development with planning | 10 minutes |
| Claude Desktop | End-to-end automation | 15 minutes |
| Cursor | Learning AI patterns | 5 minutes |

### Step 4: Try Your First Real Workflow (1 minute)
