# Architect Mode Mastery: From Simple Features to Enterprise Systems

*Progressive examples showing how architect mode scales from basic to complex scenarios*

## Introduction: Three Developers, Three Challenges

Meet three developers at different stages of their journey with Claude Code's architect mode:

- **Jordan**: Solo developer building a personal project
- **Sara**: Startup CTO managing growing complexity  
- **Alex**: Enterprise architect handling multi-service systems

Each faces increasingly complex challenges that showcase architect mode's progressive power.

## Example 1: Jordan's Journey - Simple Feature Addition

**Scenario**: Jordan is building a personal blog and wants to add a comment system with email notifications.

### The Initial Request

```bash
@architect.md "Add a comment system to my blog with email notifications when new comments are posted"
```

### The Architect Conversation

**ARCHITECT**: "I'll help you design a comment system with email notifications. Let me clarify some key decisions:

1. **Comment Structure**: Should comments support replies/threading, or simple flat comments under each post?

2. **Authentication**: Do you want anonymous comments, required email registration, or social login integration?

3. **Email Strategy**: Should notifications go to post authors only, or include comment thread subscribers?

4. **Moderation**: Do you need comment approval/moderation, or automatic publishing with spam protection?

5. **Technology Stack**: What's your current blog setup? (Static site, CMS, custom application)"

**Jordan's Response**: 
- "Flat comments for now, threading later"
- "Email required but no registration - just name + email fields"
- "Notifications to post author only initially"
- "Automatic publishing with basic spam protection"
- "Next.js blog with Prisma and PostgreSQL"

### The Exploration Phase

**Agent 1 (Backend)**: Analyzes Jordan's Next.js API routes, finds existing Prisma schema patterns, identifies current error handling.

**Agent 2 (Database)**: Reviews Prisma schema, finds blog post model structure, identifies existing relationship patterns.

**Agent 3 (Frontend)**: Examines React components, discovers styling approach (Tailwind CSS), identifies form handling patterns.

**Agent 4 (Integration)**: Finds email service setup (checks for existing providers), environment configuration patterns.

### Generated Specification Excerpt

## Example 2: Sara's Challenge - Medium Complexity Integration

**Scenario**: Sara's SaaS needs a subscription billing system with tiered plans, usage tracking, and automatic account limits.

### The Initial Request

```bash
@architect.md "Implement subscription billing with tiered plans, usage tracking, and automatic enforcement of account limits based on plan tier"
```

### The Architect Deep Dive

**ARCHITECT**: "This is a complex billing and usage system. Let me understand the full scope:

1. **Billing Integration**: Are you using Stripe, Paddle, or another provider? Do you need custom invoicing?

2. **Plan Structure**: How many tiers? What defines the limits (API calls, storage, users, features)?

3. **Usage Tracking**: Real-time tracking or batch processing? What granularity of usage data?

4. **Limit Enforcement**: Hard stops or soft warnings? Grace periods for upgrades?

5. **Existing Architecture**: How does this integrate with your current user authentication and feature access patterns?"

**Sara's Clarification**:
- "Stripe for payments, custom invoicing later"
- "3 tiers: Starter (1000 API calls/month), Pro (10k calls), Enterprise (unlimited)"
- "Real-time API call tracking with daily aggregation"
- "Hard stops with upgrade prompts"
- "Existing Express.js API with JWT auth, PostgreSQL database"

### Multi-Agent Exploration

**Agent 1 (Backend)**: Discovers Express middleware patterns, existing API structure, authentication flow, finds rate limiting setup.

**Agent 2 (Database)**: Maps user schema, identifies existing subscription table (basic), finds audit logging patterns.

**Agent 3 (Frontend)**: Analyzes React dashboard, identifies billing components, discovers notification patterns.

**Agent 4 (Integration)**: Finds Stripe test setup, environment variables, webhook configuration patterns.

**Agent 5 (Research)**: Investigates Stripe subscription best practices, usage-based billing patterns, plan upgrade flows.

### Generated Specification Highlights

```markdown
# SPEC-20250119-subscription-billing-system

## Technical Specifications

### System Architecture
- **Pattern**: Event-driven billing with usage aggregation pipeline
- **Flow**: API Call → Usage Tracking → Real-time Limits → Billing Events → Stripe Webhooks

CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  api_calls_limit INTEGER,
  price_cents INTEGER,
  stripe_price_id VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Enhanced user subscriptions
ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions ADD COLUMN
  current_period_usage JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  usage_reset_date TIMESTAMP,
  overage_warnings_sent INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

## Example 3: Alex's Enterprise Challenge - Multi-Service Architecture

**Scenario**: Alex needs to implement a notification system across multiple microservices with real-time delivery, multiple channels (email, SMS, push), user preferences, and audit logging.

### The Initial Request

```bash
@architect.md "Design a notification system for our microservices architecture supporting email, SMS, push notifications with user preferences, delivery tracking, and audit logging across 5 different services"
```

### The Enterprise Architect Conversation

**ARCHITECT**: "This is an enterprise-scale notification system. I need to understand the architectural constraints:

1. **Service Architecture**: What's your microservice communication pattern? Event bus, direct APIs, message queues?

2. **Notification Triggers**: Which services need to send notifications? User actions, system events, scheduled notifications?

3. **User Preference Complexity**: Per-channel preferences, frequency limits, content filtering, timezone handling?

4. **Delivery Requirements**: Real-time delivery, retry policies, failure handling, delivery confirmations?

5. **Compliance & Audit**: What audit data is required? GDPR considerations for notification data?"

**Alex's Enterprise Context**:
- "Event-driven with Kafka, services communicate via events"
- "User service, Order service, Billing service, Analytics service, Admin service all need notification capability"
- "Complex preferences: per-channel, per-event-type, frequency caps, quiet hours"
- "Mission-critical delivery with exponential backoff, delivery receipts"
- "Full audit trail, GDPR compliant, 7-year retention"

### Enterprise-Scale Multi-Agent Research

**Agent 1 (Backend Architecture)**: Maps existing microservice patterns, discovers Kafka setup, identifies service mesh configuration, analyzes current authentication patterns.

**Agent 2 (Database Architecture)**: Reviews distributed database patterns, finds existing event sourcing setup, identifies cross-service data consistency patterns.

**Agent 3 (Infrastructure Analysis)**: Maps container orchestration (Kubernetes), discovers monitoring setup (Prometheus), identifies logging patterns (ELK stack).

**Agent 4 (Integration Analysis)**: Finds existing external service patterns (Twilio, SendGrid), discovers API gateway configuration, identifies rate limiting strategies.

**Agent 5 (Research)**: Investigates enterprise notification patterns, GDPR compliance for notifications, distributed system design patterns, delivery guarantees in microservices.
