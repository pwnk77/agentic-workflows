**Avoid**: `architect "add notifications"`

### 2. Chain Agents Strategically
- Architecture before implementation
- Security and performance before deployment
- User validation after major changes

### 3. Use Specific Scenarios
**Good**: `user "test mobile checkout flow for returning customer purchasing high-value item"`

**Avoid**: `user "test the app"`

### 4. Leverage Agent Expertise
- `analyst` for data-heavy features
- `security` for payment/auth systems
- `performance` for user-facing features
- `quality` before major releases

### 5. Document Agent Handoffs
Each agent logs their work - use this for seamless handoffs between agents and future reference.
