Relatable Approval Workflow: Expense Reimbursement System
Problem Statement:
Build a mini-app to manage employee expense reimbursements through a three-stage workflow that’s instantly familiar in any organization:

Submission: Employees submit expense claims with details (date, amount, category, receipt image).

Manager Review: A manager reviews each claim and either approves or rejects it, optionally adding comments.

Finance Processing: Upon approval, the finance team marks the claim as “Paid” and records the payment date.

Why It’s Relatable:
Most professionals have experienced submitting expense reports and waiting for approvals. This demo mirrors that real-world process, making the workflow immediately understandable and valuable.

Workflow Breakdown
1. Submission Stage
Endpoint: POST /claims

Validation:

Date must be valid and not in the future.

Amount must be positive and within policy limits.

Receipt image file type (JPEG/PNG) and size constraints.

Data Storage: Claims stored in SQLite with status “Pending Review.”

2. Manager Review Stage
Endpoint: POST /claims/:id/review

Input: { action: "approve"|"reject", comments: string }

Logic:

Only users with “manager” role can access.

Update claim status to “Approved” or “Rejected” and record review timestamp and comments.

3. Finance Processing Stage
Endpoint: POST /claims/:id/process

Input: { paymentDate: ISODate }

Logic:

Only users with “finance” role can access.

Update status from “Approved” to “Paid” and record payment date.

Frontend Flow (Alpine.js)
Submission Form:

Bind file upload preview and input validation.

On success, display a “Pending Review” badge.

Manager Dashboard:

List pending claims with thumbnails of receipts.

Approve/Reject buttons open a modal for comments.

Real-time status update upon action.

Finance Panel:

Show all “Approved” claims awaiting payment.

Date picker for payment date.

On processing, move claim to “Paid” list and hide from panel.
