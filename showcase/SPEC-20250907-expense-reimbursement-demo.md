# 📋 SPEC: Expense Reimbursement System

## 📊 Executive Summary
A relatable three-stage approval workflow demo that mirrors real-world expense reimbursement processes. Built as a monorepo with Express.js backend and Alpine.js frontend, featuring session-based authentication, SQLite database, and modern Tailwind UI with Outfit/Poppins fonts in dark blue theme.

**Target**: Single-day demo showcasing state transitions and role-based workflows.

## 📝 Product Specifications

### User Roles & Authentication
- **Employee**: Submit expense claims
- **Manager**: Review and approve/reject claims  
- **Finance**: Process approved claims for payment
- **Authentication**: Session-based with predefined demo users

### Core Workflow States
1. **Pending Review** (initial submission)
2. **Approved/Rejected** (manager review)
3. **Paid** (finance processing)

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Submission Stage (Employee)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /claims`
- **Form Fields**:
  - Date (required, not future)
  - Amount (required, positive, within policy limits)
  - Category dropdown (meals, travel, supplies, etc.)
  - Receipt image (JPEG/PNG, base64 encoded in SQLite)
  - Description (optional)
- **Validation**: Client-side + server-side
- **Status**: Claims stored as "Pending Review"

#### 2. Manager Review Stage
- **Endpoint**: `POST /claims/:id/review`
- **Access**: Manager role only
- **Actions**: Approve or Reject with comments
- **UI**: Dashboard with claim thumbnails and review modal
- **Real-time**: Status updates without page refresh

#### 3. Finance Processing Stage  
- **Endpoint**: `POST /claims/:id/process`
- **Access**: Finance role only
- **Action**: Mark "Approved" claims as "Paid" with payment date
- **UI**: Process approved claims with date picker

### Demo Data Strategy
- **Mixed Setup**: Pre-seeded claims in various stages + live creation capability
- **Sample Users**: employee@demo.com, manager@demo.com, finance@demo.com
- **Sample Claims**: 2-3 claims in each workflow stage for demonstration

## 🏗️ Architecture Analysis

### 🔧 Backend Architecture

**Service Patterns**: Express.js layered architecture with MVC separation
- Controller-Service-Repository pattern with clear separation of concerns
- RESTful API design: `/api/claims`, `/api/claims/:id/review`, `/api/claims/:id/process`
- Session-based authentication with role-based middleware
- Centralized error handling with consistent JSON responses

### 🎨 Frontend Architecture  

**Framework & Components**: Alpine.js with Tailwind CSS for modern UI
- Alpine.js reactive components with x-data state management
- Role-based view switching (employee/manager/finance dashboards)
- Form validation with file upload support
- Modal components for claim review and processing
- Outfit/Poppins fonts with dark blue theme

### 🗄️ Database Architecture

**Schema Design**: SQLite with optimized workflow tables
- Core entities: users, claims, reviews, payments, audit_log
- Role-based user hierarchy with manager relationships
- State transition tracking with audit trails
- Base64 receipt storage for demo simplicity
- Performance indexes for dashboard queries

### 🔗 Integration Architecture

**Demo Configuration**: Local development setup with minimal dependencies
- CDN-based frontend (Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS)
- File-based SQLite database
- Express.js server with middleware stack
- Session storage for authentication state

### 📚 Research Findings

**Best Practices**: Industry patterns for expense workflow systems
- Express.js MVC architecture with middleware-based authorization
- Alpine.js component patterns for reactive UI
- SQLite optimization for demo performance
- Security considerations: session management, file upload validation
- Responsive design with accessibility considerations

## 🐛 Debug Logs  

### 🔍 Systematic Debug Session: 2025-09-07 23:15:00
- **Issue**: Multiple UI/UX issues reported:
  1. Tailwind CSS formatting not working properly
  2. Modal implementation should be simplified 
  3. View actions not working
- **Attempt 1**: Initial analysis identified CSS @layer conflicts with CDN Tailwind, complex modal structure, and potential Alpine.js issues
- **Attempt 2**: Added diagnostic logging and discovered:
  - CSS @tailwind directives incompatible with CDN approach
  - @layer and @apply directives require PostCSS compilation
  - Modal functionality working but could be streamlined
- **Attempt 3**: N/A - Root cause identified without web research needed
- **Attempt 4**: Root cause fixes implemented:
  - **CSS Fix**: Converted all @tailwind/@layer/@apply directives to standard CSS with proper RGB color values
  - **Modal Simplification**: Added unified modal system with openModal(type, title, size) method for consistency
  - **View Actions**: Enhanced with logging and unified modal approach - functionality was working but improved UX
- **Final Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Validation**: All CSS styles now work properly with CDN Tailwind, modals use unified approach for better maintainability, view actions enhanced with consistent patterns
